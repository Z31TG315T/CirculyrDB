# CirculyrDB
You didn't get it from me.

## Can I..?
Probably not. This repo has no `LICENSE.md` for a reason â€” that reason is the questionable legality of distributing copyrighted material under the guise of "fair use", and even for a moment assuming that US copyright law applies to all of the Internet.

## Then why upload anything?
In truth, for personal use. That said, I'll accept PRs if and only if:
1. the song in question isn't meritless crap;
2. you use Circulyr properly (or if your PR is maintainer-editable).
