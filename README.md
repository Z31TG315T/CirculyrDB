# CirculyrDB
You didn't get it from me.

## Can I..?
Probably not. This repo has no `LICENSE.md` for a reason â€” that reason is the questionable legality of distributing copyrighted material under the guise of "fair use", and even for a moment assuming that US copyright law applies to all of the Internet.

## Then why upload anything?
In truth, for personal use. That said, I'll accept PRs if and only if:
1. the song in question isn't meritless crap;
2. you use Circulyr properly (or if your PR is maintainer-editable).

If you use Firefox, you can make your own search engine by attaching a keyword to a bookmark. Drag [this link](https://github.com/Z31TG315T/CirculyrDB/search?q=filename:%22%s%22) to your bookmarks toolbar, or create a new bookmark pointing to:
`https://github.com/Z31TG315T/CirculyrDB/search?q=filename:%22%s%22`
...then put e.g. "lyr" in the `Keyword:` field in its properties window. Now, typing "lyr brick by boring brick" into the address bar searches this repo.
