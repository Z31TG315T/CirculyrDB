# CirculyrDB
You didn't get it from me.

## Can I..?
Probably not. This repo has no `LICENSE.md` for a reason â€” that reason is the questionable legality of even for a moment assuming that US copyright law applies to all of the Internet, and then distributing copyrighted material under the guise of "fair use".

## Then why upload anything?
In truth, for personal use. That said, I'll accept PRs if and only if:
1. the song in question isn't meritless crap;
2. you use Circulyr properly (alternatively, make mistakes and leave your PR as maintainer-editable).

**Protip:** If you use Firefox, you can make your own search engine by attaching a keyword to a bookmark. Drag [this link](https://github.com/Z31TG315T/CirculyrDB/search?q=filename:%22%s%22) to your bookmarks toolbar, or create a new bookmark pointing to:
`https://github.com/Z31TG315T/CirculyrDB/search?q=filename:%22%s%22`
...then put e.g. "lyr" in the `Keyword:` field in its properties window. Now, typing "lyr brick by boring brick" into the address bar searches this repo.

## Style guide
* Mark enjambment with a "/". If you're unsure if you need it, consider if the second line of the pair "makes sense" on its own (only helpful for native speakers).
* Don't end lines with periods or commas.
* End lines with question marks if it's a question, don't if the question continues on the next line.
* Almost never end lines with exclamation marks. There are so few times when it's actually an exclamation. And, if you have to ask...
* Only end lines with ellipses if they're the last of their paragraph and the sentence continues in the next.
* If you get confused by your own gotos, you should rethink how you're using them.
* The paragraph spacing in the lyrics should reflect the song's structure.
* If you're unsure where a line should be split, look at a matching section (verse/chorus/whatever), consider rhyming and where a vocalist would take a breath, or count syllables.
* It's "colour", "realize", and "gray".
* It's "no-one" (one, hyphenated word), "whoa" (not "woah"), and "'til" (both "'til" and "till" are correct, prefer the former; "til" without the apostraphe is plain wrong).
* Don't use nonstandard or AAVE spelling, or use unnecessary contractions (e.g. "runnin'"). Exceptions are (and this is only if they're actually pronounced differently): "wanna", "gonna", "gotta", "ain't", "'cause", "'round", "'em", "'til".
* Don't confuse "oh" and "o".
* Spell out numbers. Don't spell out acronyms, but use hyphens (e.g. "R-E-S-P-E-C-T").
* Learn to command the power of the humble semicolon.
* Ignore all of the above because I get it wrong too, sometimes.
