[v: 0.4 | 1]

Sanctus Espiritus [t: | "Holy Spirit" (mistranslation, recte "Sanctus Spiritus")]
Redeem us from our solemn hour
Sanctus Espiritus
Insanity is all around us

Sanctus Espiritus [x3]

In my darkest hours I could not foresee
That the tide could turn so fast to this degree
Can't believe my eyes, how can you be so blind?
Is the heart of stone, no empathy inside?

Time keeps on slipping away and we haven't learned
So in the end now what have we gained?

[r: Chorus]
Sanctus Espiritus
Redeem us from our solemn hour
Sanctus Espiritus
Insanity is all around us
Sanctus Espiritus
Is this what we deserve? Can we break free /
From chains of never-ending agony?
[s:]

Are they themselves to blame - the misery, the pain?
Didn't we let go, allowed it, let it grow?
If we can't restrain the beast which dwells inside
It will find its way, somehow, somewhere in time

Will we remember all of the suffering?
'Cause if we fail it will be in vain

[g: Chorus]

Sanctus Espiritus [x2]
