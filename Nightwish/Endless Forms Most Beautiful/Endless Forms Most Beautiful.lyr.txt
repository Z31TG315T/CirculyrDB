[v: 0.4 | 1]

Come on, hop on, let's take a ride
Come and meet the travellers who came to town
They have a tale from the past to tell
From the great dark between the stars

We are a special speck of dust
A fleeting moment on an ark
A celebration, a rest-haven /
Of life

[r: Pre-chorus]
Lay on a field of green with mother Eve
With father pine reaching high
Look at yourself in the eyes of I, an /
Unfolding rendezvous
[s:]

[r: Chorus]
Deep into the past
Follow the aeon path
Greet a blade of grass
Every endless form most beautiful

Alive, aware, in awe
Before the grandeur of it all
Our floating, pale-blue ark /
Of endless forms most beautiful
[s:]

Beyond aeons we take a ride /
Welcoming the shrew that survived
To see the Tiktaalik take her first walk /
Witness the birth of flight

Deeper down in Panthalassa
Eukaryote finds her way
We return to the very first one
Greet the one we'll soon become

[g: Pre-chorus]
