[v: 0.4 | 1]

One by one, we light the candles of this show
One by one, enter the theatre of the primal birth
Silently watch the planetary curtain go down
Laugh and rejoice as the powerful play greets you tonight

[r: Chorus]
We are the Edema Ruh
We know the songs the sirens sang
See us scream every tale true
The verse we leave with you will take you home
[s:]

We'll give you a key to open all of the gates
We'll show you a sea of starlight to drown all your cares
Mirror houses, the sweetest kisses and wines
A Debussy dialogue between wind and the roaring sea

[g: Chorus]

Dance to the whistle, to the play, to the story /
To infinite encores
Laugh at the royalty with sad crowns, and /
Repeat the chorus once more...

[g: Chorus]
[x2]
