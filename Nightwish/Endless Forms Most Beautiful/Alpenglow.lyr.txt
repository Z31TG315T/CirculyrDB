[v: 0.4 | 1]

We were hiding

Once upon a time, a song was heard
Giving birth to a child of earth and verse

[r: Pre-chorus]
Together we slay another fright
Every Jubjub bird, spooks of the past
Close your eyes and take a peek
The truth is easy to see
[s:]

[p: C1] We were here, roaming on the endless prairie
Writing an endless story
Building a walden of our own [s:]
[p: C2] We were here, grieving the saddened faces
Conquering the darkest places
Time to rest now and to finish the show
And become the music, one with Alpenglow [s:]

Hand in hand, guiding me into light
You, the fairytale guise in blue and white

[g: Pre-chorus]

[q: C1]
[q: C2]

You are my path, my home, my star
A beautiful tale-within-the-tale
And when the dust needs to move on /
I will tuck us in on a bed of snow
Painting white silence in the valley we built
Together we'll sleep, devoured by life

We were here, roaming the endless prairie
Writing an endless story
Building a walden of our own
[q: C2]
