[v: 0.4 | 1]

Leave the sleep and let the springtime talk
In tongues from the time before man
Listen to a daffodil tell her tale
Let the guest in, walk out, be the first to greet the morn

The meadows of heaven await harvest
The cliffs unjumped, cold waters untouched
The elsewhere creatures yet unseen
Finally, your number came up, freefall awaits the brave

[r: Chorus]
Come, taste the wine, raise the blind
They will guide you from the light
Writing notes 'til the end of time
Come, surf the clouds, race the dark
It feeds from the runs undone
Meet me where the cliff greets the sea
[s:]

The answer to the riddle before your eyes /
Is in dead leaves and fleeting skies
Returning swans and sedulous mice
Writings on the garden's book, in the minute of a lover's look

Building a sandcastle close to the shore
A house of cards from a worn-out deck
A home from the fellowship, poise and calm
Write a lyric for the song only you can understand

[g: Chorus]

Riding hard every shooting star
Come to life, open mind, have a laugh at the orthodox
Come, drink deep, let the dam of mind seep
Travel with great Ã©lan, dance a jig at the funeral

[g: Chorus]
Come
