[v: 0.4 | 1]
[c: Good luck with the Welsh intro. Unsuprisingly, "walden" means "world".]

Sain y niwl, gaunt y goydwig fwsog
Gwenithfaen, cen y coed
A'r lleuad, un gway f'adenydd /
I dapestri bywyd

Light shines bright beyond all the cities of gold /
On a road of birdsong and chocolate shops /
Of buskers, jugglers, innkeeper's welcoming call
The sound of mist, smell of moss-grown woods

[r: Chorus]
Weaving my wings from many-colored yarns
Flying higher, higher, higher into the wild
Weaving my world into tapestry of life /
Its fire golden, in my walden
[s:]

I will taste the manna in every tree
Liquid honey and wine from the distant hills
An early-morning greenwood concerto
Greets my walden with its eternal voice

[g: Chorus]
[x2]

I do not wish to evade the world
Yet I will forever build my own

Forever my own
Forever my home
