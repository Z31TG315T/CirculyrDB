[v: 0.4 | 1]

I climbed off your back
Not so long ago
To a blooming meadow
To a path you'd made for the lightest feet

[r: Chorus 1]
Mother, I am always close to you
I will be waving every time you leave
Oh, I am you - the care, the love, the memories
We are the story of one
[s:]

[r: Chorus 2]
Father, I am always close to you
I will be waving every time you leave
Oh, I am you - the care, the love, the memories
You are forever in me
[s:]

This verse, we wrote /
On a road home
For you
All this for you

Our walk has been sublime
A soaring ride and gentle lead
You have the heart of a true friend
One day we'll meet on that shore again

[g: Chorus 1]

[g: Chorus 2]
