(The deepest solace lies in understanding)
(This ancient, unseen stream)
(A shudder before the beautiful)

Awake, oceanborn
Behold this force
Bring the outside in
Explode the self to epiphany

[p: PC1] The very core of life
The soaring high of truth and light [s:]

[p: C1] The music of this awe
Deep silence between the notes
Deafens me with endless love [s:]
[p: C2] This vagrant island Earth
A pilgrim shining bright
We are shuddering /
Before the beautiful
Before the plentiful
We, the voyagers [s:]

Tales from the seas
Cathedral of green

[q: PC1]

[q: C1]
[q: C2]

The unknown, the grand show
The choir of the stars
Interstellar theatre play
The nebular curtain falls
Imagination, evolution
A species from the vale
Walks in wonder in search of /
The source of the tale

The music of this awe
Deep silence and the notes
Deafen me with endless love
[q: C2]
