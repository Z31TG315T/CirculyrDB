[v: 0.4 | 1]

These stories given to us all /
Are filled with sacrifice and robes of lust
Dissonant choirs and downcast eyes
Selfhood of a condescending ape

Behold the crown of a heavenly spy
Forged in blood of those who defy
Kiss the ring, praise and sing
He loves you dwelling in fear and sin

Fear is a choice you embrace

[r: Chorus]
Your only truth
Tribal poetry
Witchcraft filling your void
Lust for fantasy
Male necrocracy
Every child worthy of a better tale
[s:]

Pick your author from Ã  la carte fantasy
Filled with suffering and slavery
You live only for the days to come
Shoveling trash of the upper caste

Smiling mouth in a rotten head
Sucking dry the teat of the scared
A storytelling breed we are
A starving crew with show-off toys

Fear is a choice you embrace

[g: Chorus]

From words into war of the worlds
This one we forsake with scorn
From lies, the strength of our love
Mother's milk laced with poison for this newborn

Wake up, child, I have a /
Story to tell, once /
Upon a time

[g: Chorus]
