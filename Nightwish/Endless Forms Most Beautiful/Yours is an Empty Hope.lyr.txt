Tear me to bits, enjoy the scene /
Of screen name verbal vanity
Churning the words imbued in filth
Your tongue, oily water under my bridge

You have the world, it's all for you
I wish you'd find the lost in you
Grateful for the pain, it proves we're alive
Can you feel it?

I can't make you want the truth, it's up to you

Yours is an empty hope [x2]

Feed me to pigs in your fantasies
Your sea roars bitter elegies
Like Narcissus, who bribes the pool
A hollow voice, ruin with a roof

Stop! Life is now, still all for you
Turn from the hate, turn from the smoke
I see the parchment of your soul
The notes, the song, join your voice

I can let you have the world, it's all for you

Yours is an empty hope [x2]

Yours is an /
Empty hope
Yours is an
Join in now

I can let you have the world, it's all for you

Yours is an empty hope [x2]
