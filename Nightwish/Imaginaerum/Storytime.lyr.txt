[v: 0.4 | 1]

It was the night before, when all through the world
No words, no dreams, then one day /
A writer by a fire imagined all of Gaia
Took a journey into a child-man's heart

A painter on the shore imagined all the world /
Within a snowflake on his palm
Unframed by poetry, a canvas of awe
Planet Earth falling back into the stars

[r: Chorus 1]
I am the voice of Never-Never-Land
The innocence, the dreams of every man
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan
A silent kite against the blue, blue sky
Every chimney, every moonlit sight
I am the story that will read you real
Every memory that you hold dear
[s:]

I am the journey, I am the destination
I am the home, the tale that reads you
A way to taste the night, the elusive high
Follow the madness Alice, you know, once did

Imaginaerium, a dream emporium
Caress the tales and they will dream you real
A storyteller's game, lips that intoxicate
The core of all life is a limitless chest of tales

[g: Chorus 1]

I am the voice of Never-Never-Land
The innocence, the dreams of every man
Searching heavens for another Earth

Neverland, innocence
Dreams of every man, oh
Neverland, innocence
Every man, Peter Pan
