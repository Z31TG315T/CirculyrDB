[v: 0.4 | 1]

I want my tears back

The treetops, the chimneys
The snowbed stories, winter-grey
Wildflowers, those meadows /
Of heaven, wind in the wheat

A railroad 'cross waters
The scent of grandfatherly love
Blue bayous, Decembers
Moon through a dragonfly's wings

[r: Chorus 1]
Where is the wonder, where's the awe?
Where's dear Alice knocking on the door?
Where's the trapdoor that takes me there?
Where the real is shattered by a Mad March Hare
[s:]

[r: Chorus 2]
Where is the wonder, where's the awe?
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for?
Before the years take me
I wish to see the lost in me
[s:]

I want my tears back
I want my tears back now

A ballet on a grove
Still growing young all alone
A rag doll, a best friend
The voice of Mary Costa

[g: Chorus 1]

[g: Chorus 2]
[x2]

I want my tears back
I want my tears back now

[g: Chorus 2]
[x2]

I want my tears back
I want my tears back now
