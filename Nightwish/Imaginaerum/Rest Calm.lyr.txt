[v: 0.4 | 1]

I want to die in a seaside hotel
Lanes of memory paved by sweet frozen moments

[r: Pre-chorus]
Deathbed memories of home
Never let me go
[s:]

Every little memory resting calm in me, resting in a dream, smiling back at me
[p: C1] The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home, to caress the river with awe
Within there's every little memory resting calm with me, resting in a dream, smiling back at me
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home, rest calm and remember me [s:]

You are the moon pulling my black waters
You are the lamp in my dark closet

Stay by my side until it all goes dark forever
When silent, the silence comes closer

[g: Pre-chorus]

Within there's every little memory resting calm in me, resting in a dream, smiling back at me
[q: C1]

Every little memory (Resting calm in me, resting in a dream, smiling back at me)
Resting in a dream (Calling me to come back home, to caress the river with awe)
Every little memory (Resting calm in me, resting in a dream, smiling back at me)
Resting in a dream (Calling me to come back home, rest calm and remember me)

Resting in me

Within there's every little memory resting calm with me, resting in a dream, smiling back at me
[q: C1]
