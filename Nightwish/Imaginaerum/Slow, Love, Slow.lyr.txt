[v: 0.4 | 1]

Come and share this painting with me
Unveiling of me, the magician that never failed
This deep sigh, coiled around my chest, intoxicated by a major chord
I wonder - do I love you, or the thought of you?

[r: Chorus]
Slow, love, slow
Only the weak are not lonely
[s:]

Southern blue, morning dew
Let down your guards, I-love-yous
Icecream castles, lips-to-ear rhymes
A slumber deeper in time

[g: Chorus]

Slow
Slow, love, slow

Slow [x2]
