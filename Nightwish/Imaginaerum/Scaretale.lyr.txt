[f: children singing Ring a Ring o' Roses]

Once upon a time in a daymare
Dying to meet you, little child, enter, enter this sideshow
Time for bed, the cradle still rocks
Thirteen chimes on a dead man's clock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock

The bride will lure you, cook you, eat you
Your dear innocence boiled to feed the evil in need of fear
Burning farms and squeeling pigs
Pool of snakes to swim with, oh, sweet poison, bite me, bite me

Ladies and gentlemen
Be heartlessly welcome /
To Cirque De Morgue!
And what a show we have for you tonight!

Restless souls will put on their dancing shoes
Mindless ghouls with a lot of limbs to lose
Illusionists, contortionists
Tightrope walkers tightening the noose

Horde of spiders, claws and tentacles
Laughing harpies with their talons ripping - sher-chrisss, per-vizz
The pendulum still sways for you
Such are the darks here to show you, child in a corner, fallen mirrors, a kingdom in cinders
