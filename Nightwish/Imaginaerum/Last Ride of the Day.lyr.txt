[v: 0.4 | 1]

We live in every moment but this one
Why don't we recognize the faces loving us so
What's God, if not the spark that started life
Smile of a stranger, sweet music, starry skies

Wonder, mystery, wherever my road goes
Early wake-ups in a moving home
Scent of fresh-mown grass in the morning sun
Open theme park gates waiting for...

Riding the day, every day into sunset
Finding the way back home

[r: Chorus]
Once upon a night we'll wake to the carnival of life
The beauty of this ride ahead such an incredible high
It's hard to light a candle, easy to curse the dark instead
This moment the dawn of humanity, last ride of the day
[s:]

Wake up, dead boy, enter adventure-land
Tricksters, magicians will show you all that's real
Careless jugglers, snakecharmers by your trail
Magic of a moment (Abracadabra)

Riding the day, every day into sunset
Finding the way back home

[g: Chorus]
[x2]
