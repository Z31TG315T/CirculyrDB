[v: 0.4 | 1]

It's a long road down the river, deep and wild
Every twist and turn a wonder-dale
It's a scary ride we'd give anything to take
Let yourself bleed, leave a footprint on every island you see

Hey you, child of rape, the riverbed awaits
(Snow-white) Pitch-black, your life, such strife
(Heavenward) Deep down, I'll show you such sights
Believe it, we live as we scream (Believe it, we live as we dream)

[r: Chorus]
He will go down, he will drown, drown, deeper down
The river wild will take your only child
He will go down, he will drown, drown, deeper down
The mills grind slow in a riverbed ghost town
[x2]

He will go down, he will drown, drown, deeper down
If you want me, do come across (Do come across)
[s:]

What is it you dream of, child of mine?
The magic ride, the mermaid cove?
Never met a kinder heart than yours
Let it bleed, leave a footprint on every island you see

I am the painted faces, the toxic kiss
Sowing of doubt, troll beneath the bridge
(Come across) Death by a thousand cuts
Believe it, we live as we scream (Believe it, we live as we dream)

[g: Chorus]

I am the desert-scape, the sand inside your hourglass
I am the fear and abuse, the leper children, every eye sewn shut

We will go down, we will drown, drown, deeper down
The river wild will be our last ride
We will go down, we will drown, drown, deeper down
The mills grind slow in a riverbed ghost town

Beautifully shy as you are
Never lose your heart, and do come across

He will go down, he will drown, drown, deeper down
The mills grind slow in a riverbed ghost town
He will go down, he will drown, drown, deeper down
If you want me, do come across (Do come across)
