(This Eden)
(This Eden is our paradise forever)

Rebirth, awakened
We've only begun
No longer forsaken
The two are now one

[p: C1] We are here by design
I am yours and you are mine
Eternally intertwined [s:]
This Eden is our paradise forever

This Eden is our paradise forever

Eons behind us
Not captive to time
A future before us /
That we will define

[q: C1]
This Eden is our paradise forever

This Eden is our paradise
This Eden

All alone and in our own starlight tonight
We'll traverse the universe tonight

[q: C1]
This Eden is our paradise
[q: C1]
This Eden is our paradise forever
(This Eden is our paradise forever)
This Eden is our paradise forever

(This Eden is our paradise forever)
This Eden
[x2]
