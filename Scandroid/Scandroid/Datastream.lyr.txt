I feel so far from my home
'Til the lights start fading
Streets come alive in the night when we're alone

Your thoughts are naked tonight
In this neon glow
Lit up like a firefly, you circuits are online
And ready to go

[p: C1] Open yourself to me, we're better entwined
Breathing in binary, our systems aligned
Searching for frequencies and scanning through time [s:]
Both lost in the datastream that's linking our minds

Now I don't feel so alone
When the lights start fading
We bathe in the shadow of the city far above

Come hide away with me tonight
In this neon home
Glowing like a firefly, the datastream online
And ready to flow

[q: C1]
Both lost in the datastream that's linking our minds

[q: C1]
Both lost in the datastream
[q: C1]
Both lost in the datastream that's linking our minds
