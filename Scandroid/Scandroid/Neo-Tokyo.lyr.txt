(We'll dream of Neo-Tokyo tonight)
(We'll dream of Neo-Tokyo)
(We'll dream of Neo-Tokyo tonight)

Neon lights glisten off the streets
The moonlight swallowed up by breathing electricity
Salvation hovers in the sky
Dream of a life inside while we escape just to survive

[r: Chorus]
Let go, take flight
Dreams begin to reignite
So clear, so bright
We're glowing in the dead of night
Plug in, online
The datastream linking our minds
Circuits entwined
We'll dream of Neo-Tokyo tonight
[s:]

We're made of flesh, circuit and bone
The only world we've known, these empty streets we walk alone
Salvation blocking out the sun
Beneath its shadow cast, I dream with my Aphelion

[g: Chorus]

A new hope glistens off the streets
Rainfall washes away the memories in binary
Salvation bathes us in its glow
We look up to the sky and dream of Neo-Tokyo

[g: Chorus]

We'll dream of Neo-Tokyo tonight (We'll dream of Neo-Tokyo tonight)
We'll dream of Neo-Tokyo tonight
