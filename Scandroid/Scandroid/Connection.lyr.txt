[v: 0.4 | 1]

(Connection) [x2]

I'm always looking back in time
Memories of all the things that I have left behind
And sometimes, all this is too much
I'd gladly trade in virtual for someone I can touch

[r: Chorus]
Let's escape
Deactivate
Forget about perfection tonight
Come with me
And let's go see
If we can make connection tonight
[s:]

It's always burning in my mind
Memories are getting lost beneath the sands of time
And sometimes I'm trapped inside the game
I'd gladly disconnect from it with someone who feels the same

[g: Chorus]

Let's close our eyes
And make distractions all subside
And let's defect and disconnect
From everything outside

[g: Chorus]

(Connection) [x3]
