(Salvation code)
(The salvation code)

(The salvation code)

I hold on to the notion
That I just wasn't born to die
Buried beneath the motion of life /
I never stopped to question why

I've been dreaming of a saviour /
To pull me from this lowly place
She's analog and digital
Halo of light around her face

[r: Pre-chorus]
The path becoming clearer
I'm getting closer
And everyday I'm nearer
(To the salvation code)

(The salvation code) [x2]

It's all clearer now, and I hear her now
And I'm nearer to (The salvation code)
[x2]
[s:]

I'm still sticking to the notion
There's a bigger story left to tell
Sunk way down low in Tokyo
In the lowest level of this hell

Transmissions coming from my saviour
Receiving in this lonely place
They are analog and digital
And they're guiding me through time and space

[g: Chorus]

It's all clearer now, and I hear her now [x2]
And I'm nearer to (The salvation code)

[g: Chorus]

(Salvation code)
