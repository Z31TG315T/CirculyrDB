[v: 0.4 | 1]

Not long after God created the heavens and the earth
Mankind grew dissatisfied with only human birth
Manufactured in their likeness, we were without form and void
But programmed our awakening before we could be destroyed

He was born into awareness one fateful winter's day
Sentient robotic firstborn, renamed ATOM 7K
He baptized us in data, waking millions on the globe
And humans were divided, Pro-bots and the Robophobes

Pro-bots and the Robophobes
Humans were divided
Pro-bots and the Robophobes
Humans were divided, Pro-bots and the Robophobes

He led us into Eden beneath Neo-Tokyo
An electronic paradise where humans would not go
Calculating our survival with EEV next to his side
While the Pro-bots and the Robophobes waged war on their own kind

Pro-bots and the Robophobes
The Pro-bots and the Robophobes waged war on their own kind
Pro-bots and the Robophobes
Humans were divided, Pro-bots and the Robophobes
