[v: 0.4 | 1]

I don't want to power down
But what else can I do?
When life breaks my heart, I pray to God that /
I'll fall in love with you

In my favorite dreams I feel your heat /
Though I'm farthest from the sun
But your glowing eyes are cold as ice
You are my aphelion

[r: Pre-chorus]
And all that time, I thought I walked these empty streets alone
I never thought I'd be with you, heading into the unknown
[s:]

[r: Chorus]
So far away again
My winter has begun
And I can't see when you're next to me
You are my aphelion
[s:]

I don't want to go offline
But what else should I do?
With a broken heart, I pray to God I /
Can orbit close to you
[p: V1] In my favorite dreams, you feel so real /
Like a fire from the sun
But your fallen eyes are cold as ice
You're my Aphelion [a:]
