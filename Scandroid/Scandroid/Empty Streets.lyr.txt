Beware the shadows of the drones
Destruction wrapped in pretty silicone
They've taken everyone I've known
And now I walk these empty streets alone

[r: Pre-chorus and Chorus]
In my memory the past is fading
The future has been redesigned
It's hard to focus on it when I'm running out of time

Surrounded by streetlights at midnight
My destination is unknown
I walk these empty streets alone
Digital dreams thrive in the moonlight
I'm only flesh, circuit, and bone
I walk these empty streets alone (I walk these empty streets alone)
[s:]

Beware the faces of the clones
Deception sent from Neo-Tokyo
They've erased everyone I've known
And still I walk these empty streets alone

[g: Pre-chorus and Chorus]

I walk these empty streets alone

[g: Pre-chorus and Chorus]

I walk these empty streets alone
I walk these empty streets alone (I walk these empty streets alone) [x2]
Surrounded by streetlights at midnight
I walk these empty streets alone [x2]
