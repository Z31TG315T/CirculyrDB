[v: 0.4 | 1]

[r: Chorus]
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on
[s:]
[x2]

In violent times /
You shouldn't have to sell your soul
In black and white
They really, really ought to know

Those one-track minds /
That took you for a working boy
Kiss them goodbye
You shouldn't have to jump for joy [x2]

[g: Chorus]

They gave you life
And in return you gave them hell
As cold as ice
I hope we live to tell the tale [x2]

[g: Chorus]

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you

And when you've taken down your guard
If I could change your mind
I'd really like to break your heart [x2]

[g: Chorus]
[x2]

And when you've taken down your guard
I'd really like to break your heart
I'd really like to shout
