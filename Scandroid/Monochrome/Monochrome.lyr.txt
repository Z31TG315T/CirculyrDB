(People pass me by like they are in a dream)
(So many voices clash inside the datastream)
(Within the static, I know I'm not alone)
(In a world of color, I see in monochrome)

Bright neon colors of the city lights
But something's missing in their tone
My mind is numb, life as a technolyte
I know this world is not my home

People pass me by like they are in a dream
So many voices clash inside the datastream
Within the static, I know I'm not alone
In a world of color, I see in monochrome

This world is not my home
I see in monochrome

Jet from my living space, I need some room to breathe
The undercity calls to clear my circuitry
And as I travel downward from Old Tokyo
I trade a world of color for one of monochrome

And still people pass me by, living in a dream
So many voices scream inside the datastream
Within the chaos I know I'm not alone
'Cause in this world of color, we see in monochrome

Bathed in the color of the city lights
But something's missing in their tone
There's more to this life as a technolyte
When I know this world is not my home

This world is not my home
I see in monochrome
I know I'm not alone
We see in monochrome [x2]
(We see in monochrome)
