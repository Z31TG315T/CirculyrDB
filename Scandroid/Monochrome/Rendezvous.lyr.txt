(Rendezvous)

It's you and me
Meeting in secrecy
As we confide
Forget the world outside

(Anticipating that moment in time)

[r: Chorus]
I'm flowing with an electricity
The night is filled with thoughts of you
As we move closer to each other eagerly
You know I cannot wait to rendezvous
[s:]

You know I cannot wait to (Rendezvous)

It's me and you
Planning our rendezvous
As we aspire
Consumed by your desire

(Anticipating that moment in time)

[g: Chorus]

Rendezvous
You know I cannot wait to (Rendezvous)

[g: Chorus]

Rendezvous
You know I cannot wait to (Rendezvous)
Rendezvous
(Rendezvous)
You know I cannot wait to rendezvous
