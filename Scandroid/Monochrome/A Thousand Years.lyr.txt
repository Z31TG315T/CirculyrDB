[v: 0.4 | 1]

We woke up on the floor, our bodies intertwined
You're doing that thing you do when something's on your mind
Restlessness and worries for a future that's unknown
But I'd travel through both space and time to make sure you will never be alone

[r: Chorus]
I would wait a thousand years for you
I would brave new frontiers for you
I would trade a thousand years for you
A thousand years, a thousand years
[s:]

We head into the night and fade into the streets
As rain on the city falls, the taste is bittersweet
Restlessness and worries for a future far away
I'll travel into the unknown to make sure you will see another day

[g: Chorus]

Through complication
Through the unknown
With determination
I'll make sure you'll never be alone

[g: Chorus]

(I would wait) A thousand years
(I would trade) A thousand years
(I would wait) A thousand years
I would wait a thousand years for you
A thousand years for you
I would wait a thousand years for you
