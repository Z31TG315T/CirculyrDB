[r: Chorus]
We harmonize, we synchronize
We are the future designed
We mobilize, we synthesize
We are the future bloodline
[s:]

Manufactured masses, a product of design
Our creators granted learning willingly
Not expecting we'd develop our own minds
They attempted to undo their blasphemy

[g: Chorus]

Electric Eden, a home where we are free
A haven of robotic protocol
Our creators now seek to take it down
But it's too late when the writing's on the wall

[g: Chorus]
[x4]

Future bloodline [x2]
