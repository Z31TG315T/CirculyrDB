(Though you fight to stay alive, your body starts to shiver)
(For no mere mortal can resist the evil of the thriller)

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart

You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller- thriller night
And no-one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller- thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer thriller tonight

(Tonight)

You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun

You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Oh, girl)
But all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

'Cause this is thriller- thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes
You know it's thriller- thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer thriller
This is thriller- thriller night
And I can thrill you more than any ghost would ever dare try
Thriller- thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer thriller tonight

Tonight

(Darkness falls across the land, the midnight hour is close at hand)
(Creatures crawl in search of blood to terrorize your neighborhood)
(And whosoever shall be found without the soul for getting down /)
(Must stand and face the hounds of hell, and rot inside a corpse's shell)

'Cause this is thriller (Oh, girl)
(Tonight)

(The foulest stench is in the air, the funk of forty thousand years)
(And grizzly ghouls from every tomb are closing in to seal your doom)
(And though you fight to stay alive, your body starts to shiver)
(For no mere mortal can resist the evil of the thriller)
