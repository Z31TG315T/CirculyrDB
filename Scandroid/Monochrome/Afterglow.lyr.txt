(You and I will ride the afterglow)

When we're living under midnight
Lights shimmer off the walls
These feelings rise into the sky

Our fears faded with the twilight
Our tears mingle as we fall
In moonlight, this love is amplified

[p: C1] In stereo we both let go
Into the flow, you and I will ride the afterglow [s:]

The last traces of the sunlight
They wish us their last farewell
The streetlights lit up like fireflies

The faint glow of distant starlight
Keep the secrets that we tell
Our bodies' vibrations multiply

[q: C1]
[p: C2] Beneath the dome, so far from home
In monochrome, you and I will ride the afterglow [s:]

Two shadows in the moonlight
Two bodies parallel
We're lost in the datastream tonight

(You and I will ride the afterglow)

(In stereo we both let go)
(Into the flow, you and I will ride the afterglow)
(Beneath the dome, so far from home)
(In monochrome, you and I will ride the afterglow)

(You and I will ride the afterglow)
