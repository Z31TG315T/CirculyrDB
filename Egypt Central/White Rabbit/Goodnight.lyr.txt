[v: 0.4 | 1]

A light comes through the glass
And shines in on the past
The day you left too fast
The day I saw you last

[r: Pre-chorus]
A faded photograph
The time we thought we had
And I just want you back
[s:]

[r: Chorus]
Goodnight, goodnight
This pain won't last forever
I'll bury this, bury this inside (Please don't say goodbye)

Goodnight, goodnight
It doesn't mean forever
I'll bury this, bury this inside
It's my last kiss goodnight
[s:]

You're there in black and gray
You're always in the frame
It's like you always say
Things never stay the same

[g: Pre-chorus]

[g: Chorus]

If I could go back in time
If I could, I'd turn it backwards
I swear I could save your life
No-one knows how bad this hurts

Taken too soon
You know I lost the best in me
To go on without you
I lay you down to sleep

[g: Chorus]

(A faded photograph)
(The time we thought we had)
