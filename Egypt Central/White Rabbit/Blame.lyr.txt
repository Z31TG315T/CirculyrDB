[v: 0.4 | 1]

A lie is like a dirty knife, a jagged blade
And I can feel it in my spine, deceiver
Your tongue is gonna get pulled out, your quick lips sealed
And I am going to shut your mouth forever

[r: Pre-chorus]
It's always your fault (And it's my fault)
You won't change (I won't change)
What's your problem (You)
You won't listen to me, you keep pushing...
[s:]

[p: C1] Blame
It's a dangerous game to play
Better watch who you betray [s:]
'Cause I won't take your blame
[p: C2] Blame /
Will chase you down someday
It will not fade away [s:]
There will be hell to pay when I come back to find you
I'll show what happens when you blame

I know want to run and hide, you scared stiff snitch
Nowhere you can go this time, it's over

[g: Pre-chorus]

[q: C1]
'Cause I won't take your blame
[q: C2]
There will be hell to pay when I come back to find you
I'll show what happens when you blame

You know I'll come back to find you
I'll show you what happens when you...

[q: C1]
'Cause I won't take your blame
[q: C2]
'Cause I won't take your blame
[q: C1]
You will have hell to pay when I come back to find you
I'll show what happens when you blame
