Seven a.m. and I'm walking again
Back to bury myself in the snow
With a part of me gone, and it's hard to hold on
To a person that I used to know

And it kills me inside, I am buried alive
I am nothing but flesh over bone
But I can't think about it, I'm not going to change
I am better off being alone
Better off being alone

[p: C1] The drug, the drug is what understands me
Silence stole the voices in my head, whoa
Drink myself to death on cocaine candy
Twenty-one-gun salute when they find me dead [s:]
When they find me dead

In the back of the house with a gun in my mouth
And a mirror in front of my face
I have looked for a reason, just one simple reason
For why I am worth being saved

But I'll never get out, so I put the gun down
It's a slow suicide that I choose
So I give in again, I sit down and breathe in
I don't care about what I will lose
What I will lose

[q: C1]
When they find me dead

I feel like this will never end
The curse under my skin
More than air I breathe, you must believe I need the drug
I'm always on the run
From the addict I've become
More than air I breathe, you must believe I need the drug
(I need the drug) You must believe I need the drug [x2]

(The drug, the drug is what understands me)

[q: C1]
