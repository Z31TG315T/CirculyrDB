[v: 0.4 | 1]

I'll cut out the broken hearts down Union Avenue
Let the streets run red with my revenge
You can't fake apologies for everything you do
You can't repay the price that's on your head
The price that's on your head

[r: Chorus]
When the sky comes down over this ghost town, you'll be first against the wall
With our guns held high in the dead of night, you'll be first against the wall (Come on)
Test me, you'll be first to take the fall
When the sky comes down over this ghost town, you'll be first- first against the wall
[s:]

Scatter like the roach, like the insect that you are
Cowards always try to get away
No matter where you run, no matter where you hide
I will hunt you down, you can't escape
You can't escape

[g: Chorus]

Test me and you'll be shot down [x2]
Shot down

[g: Chorus]

First against the wall
