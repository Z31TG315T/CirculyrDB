[v: 0.4 | 1]

Get me out of this god-forsaken city
Let me start over somewhere new
All of my friends have turned up missing
I can't blame it on my youth

Throw my heart in the well of wishing
Pay my toll to just move on
Ask myself to, please, forgive me
All my innocence is gone

[g: Chorus]
Backfire, they backfire
All these choices you're scared to make
'Cause they backfire, they backfire
All these choices you're scared to make
[s:]

All the streetlights lead me to the river
All my ghosts, not far behind
If I could leave this town forever
It seems like no-one's on my side

Duck your head and run for cover
Cross that bridge and just move on
Save myself but lose another
All my innocence is gone

[g: Chorus]

And I can't find a cure
Oh, to fix me anymore
And all these things I've done
Have got me on the run
Got me on the run

Backfire, they backfire
All these choices

[g: Chorus]

Get me out of this god-forsaken city
Let me start over somewhere new
