[p: C1] Your magic white rabbit /
Has left its writing on the wall [s:]
[p: C2] We follow like Alice
And just keep diving down the hole [s:]

You can't fix your broken promise
Our ties have come undone
I will not be used to be battered and abused, it's the reason why I choose to cut my losses
Your lies fool no-one

Your magic white rabbit
Your white room, straight-jacket

[q: C1]
[q: C2]
[p: C3] We're falling and we're losing control
You're pulling us, dragging us down this dead-end road [s:]
[q: C2]

You can't offer your poison to me
In your kingdom of filth
(White rabbit, straight-jacket)

(I won't be pushed aside, I will be heard)
(I will get what I want, what I deserve)

I won't be pushed aside, I will be heard
I will get what I want, what I deserve
