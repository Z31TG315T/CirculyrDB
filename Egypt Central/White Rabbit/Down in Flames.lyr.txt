(The sun will be dark)
(And-uh the moon will give no light)
(Heavenly bodies will be shaken down and we will see him coming)
(Coming on a cloud with power, and /)
(I tell you the truth, yeah)
(This generation will not pass /)
(Until all of his prophecies have been realized)

This separation makes a fool of you and I
Blank stares and credit cards allege the great divide
You think you're safe if you never choose a side
Are you sheep, or wolves in disguise? [x2]

[r: Pre-chorus]
(Wake up)
It's now or never
You are all a slave (It's now or never)
[s:]

[p: C1] Wake up your generation (Right now)
Wake up, and save the nation (???)
Wake up determination
I am afraid we're going down [s:]
Afraid we're going down in flames

I miss the soldiers of a new forgotten war
And I miss the friends that I can not see anymore
We want a victory, but I cannot ignore
Your self-inflicted genocide, you are all a slave

[g: Pre-chorus]

[q: C1]
Afraid we're going down in flames

[q: C1]
Afraid we're going down
[q: C1]
Afraid we're going down in flames
