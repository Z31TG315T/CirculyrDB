[v: 0.4 | 1]

Conflicted, can you forgive and forget?
You can't fix it when you live in regret
Are you afflicted, or does it burn inside?
Burn inside

(Carpe diem)

[r: Chorus]
Say
Say what you have to say
Before time slips away
Make the change
[s:]

Don't deny it, you're terrified of yourself
You can't fight it, I know you're screaming for help
You chase riots but you run in blind
Run in blind

(Carpe diem)

[g: Chorus]
[x3]

[g: Chorus]

Say (Don't deny it, you're terrified of yourself)
Say what you have to say (You can't fight it, I know you're screaming for help)
Before time slips away (You chase riots, but you run in blind)
Make the change (Run in blind)
