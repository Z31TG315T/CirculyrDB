Questions that build up, like bricks, stacked with anger
Patiently waiting for more
She has the confident strength of an army /
Gathered, and waiting for war

Stay (Stay)
Will you stay?

[p: C1] If you're dying to leave and walk out on me
Stand up and say it to my face
Will you hold on or let go? 'Cause I deserve to know
Make up your mind and set me free [s:]
If you're dying to leave

Quiet in comfort, she holds her decision
Further back now than before
And I find a place between guilt and suspicion
Memories pulling in my core

Stay (Stay)
Will you stay?

[q: C1]
If you're dying to leave

Make your mind up, don't leave me hanging here
Take this noose away
[x2]

Stay (Stay)
Will you stay?

[q: C1]
If you're dying to leave, yeah, yeah
Will you hold on or let go? 'Cause I deserve to know
Make up your mind and set me free
If you're dying to leave
If you're dying
Dying to leave
