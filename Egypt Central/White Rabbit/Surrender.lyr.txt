[v: 0.4 | 1]

Breathe in and bleed out /
The venom that you have been given
Dig in and crawl out
Make your decision

Are you still with me?
Or, did you lose your faith when it was shaken?
[p: PC1] Are you still with me?
Do you still believe? [s:]

[r: Chorus]
This is a call to all the lost
A note to those misunderstood
I'll get your point across
I won't give in, I'll never surrender
[s:]

I've been torn down
Rebuilding the trust of the fallen
Worn thin with doubt
Follow your calling

[q: PC1]

[g: Chorus]

I need to dig in, not scratching the surface, but tearing a hole
Revisit my purpose, get back what I sold

[q: PC1]

[g: Chorus]

This is a call to all the lost [x3]
I won't give in, I'll never surrender
