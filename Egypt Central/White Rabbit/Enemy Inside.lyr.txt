[v: 0.4 | 1]

I close my eyes to no avail, three days of aching, sleepless-
I wish these sheets would suffocate me while I wait
I love the cuts that make the lines, arranged in beautiful designs
I fight with a sharp side of a razor blade
It's not right, I can't escape the choice I made

[p: C1] One last chance to get me through tonight
One last dance with the lady dressed in white
I lost myself, I lost my alibis [s:]
One last time to feed the enemy /
Inside of me

It's getting harder to inhale, a quick fix to clear my secrets
Eyes dialate and stop the winding second hand
It turns the hours into days, behind the sunset my life fades /
To gray; alone again with a razor blade
It's not right, I can't escape the choice I made

[q: C1]
One last time to feed the enemy

It's quiet now, like the moments after a murder
The younger me inside can't believe the things he saw tonight
Face to face I'm screaming at myself / (Face to face I'm screaming at myself)
For help (Myself)
Tonight [x7]

[q: C1]
One last time to feed the enemy /
Inside of me [x2]

One last chance to get me through tonight
