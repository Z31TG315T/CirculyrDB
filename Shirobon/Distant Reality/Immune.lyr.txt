[v: 0.4 | 1]

You run, you run, you run so far
Left behind the stones that bruised you black
You might be running, running, but you've been /
Learning to convince yourself there's no more attack

You now know how to end this feud now you've become immune
You've jumped out of the fire
You can tell when being stuck in the midst of all the fumes
You can jump out of the fire

[p: C1] You can't make light
You will realize
You can't mend the lie
You will realize [s:]

No-one, no-one, no-one can burn
Now you've put the fire out, they can read the signs
You threw all your wishes into the wishing well
But you never returned

It is the journey that makes you run

[q: C1]
It is the journey that makes you run
