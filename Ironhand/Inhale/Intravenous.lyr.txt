[v: 0.4 | 1]

Dressed white to the right
The rest to the left
My eyes are all dried
Pipes writhing in my chest

[r: Verse 2]
The rot that I feel in me
Give me what I need to be
The meds that I need in me
Inject it intravenously
[s:]

Inject [x4]

Adrena-lingering
Deep in my skin
Its twitch makes my insides itch
Hurts like a bitch

I wish that I was high, so I could hide 'til it's outside of my mind

Inject

[g: Verse 2]

Inject [x4]
