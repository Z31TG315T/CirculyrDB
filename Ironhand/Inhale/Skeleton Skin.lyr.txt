Step back from the mirror
And step into my room
I've many things in here to show to you

So step over the corpses
And step into my tomb
There's a mirror here for you to look into (And they all sing)

[r: Pre-chorus]
(Roots strangle bone and wrap it all in gauze)
(Have you never seen a smile like this before?)
[s:]
[x2]

[p: C1] I am a skeleton, wrapped in skin
I am a heretic, strapped with sin
I once was human, now dead within
Why am I happier than I've ever been? [s:]
[x2]

One side with the many faces
One smile, yet no traces /
Of us through and through
Ask the mirror of what they do

Through skin, just slide it in
One is seen, the worse is hidden
I live in bedridden /
Sickly state, no longer living

[g: Pre-chorus]
[x2]

[q: C1]
[q: C1]
Than I've ever been [x3]
In my skeleton skin
