[p: V1] The pain is not as bad when I am dreaming
The fear, not as crippling when I wake [s:]

[r: Chorus]
I've lost so much blood, my heart is empty
I'm dead inside (Dead inside)
The drugs aren't working, my mind is gone
And I'm dead inside (Dead inside)
[s:]

My mind is gone, the pain is here
A little push and it brings my smile near
[p: V2] It does it every time
I do it all the time [s:]

[g: Chorus]

The room starts spinning and my throat grows tight
Hands are shaking and my veins are bright
Hit the morphine dripper again [x2]

High pitched noise buzzing in my head
It'll never go away 'til I'm good and dead
Hit the morphine dripper again, again, again!

[q: V1]
[q: V2]

[g: Chorus]
