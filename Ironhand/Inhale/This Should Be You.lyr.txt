He says you're on your own [x2]
[x2]

I can't consider you my friend
Not when I when I want your life to end
And even though I want to die
I have no dreams of suicide

But my heart is growing bitter
And it is slowing, still
And everything I cherish /
You've made sure has been killed
I lie here at your mercy
And I shall remain, until...

[f: ECG flatline]

This should be you! [x3]

I could say the last time I felt this way
There was not enough time to diagnose
Administer anything to numb this /
War machine inside me, running it's course

And I know it's true
They would never lie to me, would they?
[x4]

This should be you! [x2]
