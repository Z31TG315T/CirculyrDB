Get killed! [x2]

My head is swimming in violence
I'm afraid I can no longer hide this
The monsters are crawling inside this
You're dying for me to try this to you

Stopped searching for a purpose
Stopped fighting with the pain
It all means nothing to me now
Because the last thing I feel is metal in my veins

My throat is dry, my words are hoarse
This plague inside me's nearly run it's course
I hope I...

Get killed! [x2]

I hear the valkyries calling
I can feel my blood pressure falling
The things I do are appalling
And there is no point in stalling for me

Get killed!
