[v: 0.4 | 1]

It's all the same
But who's to blame /
When all's the same /
And earns no name?
Lives every day /
The same old way
It never pays

[r: Chorus]
And every day is all the same
So I built a bomb to make it change
Write my signature with the flames and /
I've lived a day that's not the same
[s:]

It's all the same

[g: Chorus]

It's all the same
All the same [repeat]
