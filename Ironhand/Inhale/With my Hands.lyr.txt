[v: 0.4 | 1]

She cradles my fingers
And whispers like tubes in my throat

Her watery eyes glow /
So blue, past the brim of my eye

[p: C1] She knew what I could do
With my hands, with my hands
And she knew it was coming
What I've done, what I've done

And she knew well what I could do
With my hands, with my hands
And she knew it was coming
What I've done, what I've done [s:]
With my hands

[q: C1]
With my hands [x5]
