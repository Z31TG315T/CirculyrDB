[v: 0.4 | 1]

To think I was like you /
So healthy I could breathe fresh air
Now chained to a bottle, oxygen throttle
Someone light a match in my lungs /
To match my...

Words of disgust at my situation
Can only hope for a complication
Pull out my I-V and give it a blow
And away I go

[r: Chorus]
Who will save me?
I need a hero, I need a hero
I need a villain, to be my hero
Who will kill me?
I need a hero, I need a hero
I need a villain, to pull the plug for me
[s:]

To think you'll be like me
Perhaps it's only a matter of time
'Til you inherit this gurney I'm in
Take the time you've left to sin
You only get... (once)

Once you saw what the pain was like
Your smile of hope became a broken, worried /
Glare of fear
Because you know that you'll be here /
In just a matter of years

[g: Chorus]
