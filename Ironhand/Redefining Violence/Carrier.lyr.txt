[v: 0.4 | 1]

Just like they all will say
This is the end of days
[x2]

[r: Chorus 1]
Behold the Carrier
The Sinner King's son
Behold the Carrier
The crusade has begun
[s:]

[p: V1] You are my son
You are my plague [s:]
You are the catalyst /
To end all days

(The Ironhanded came to him)
(And burdened his child)
You must do /
What I cannot ever accomplish

[g: Chorus 1]

Behold the king of men
The liar of our times
Harbinger of decay
Condemner of such crimes

[q: V1]

You are the Carrier
The Sinner King's son
You are the Carrier
Mankind's war has begun
