Yes, my eyes see clear
They know one thing
Despite all reason /
You all keep marching on

My eyes see clear, they know one thing
Despite all wounds, you all keep marching on
Down a path of bigotry /
Of torture and oppression, of decay and recession /
Of skin ripped and bones snapped /
Of all the children lied to, instilling hopes for the impossible
The cost of contentment is ignorance, resentment
Giving unbacked answers for humanity's insecurities

Why would fight when there is no cause?
Why would you sing when you're spitting lies?
Why would you dance when you're crumbling down?
Why would you pray when there is no god?
[x2]

A hoping heart with a lemming mind
The vaporous god no-one can find
Refuse to progress alongside time
(You bleed this blood for nothing)

"We're not alone," you tell yourselves
But alone- alone is what you are
Alone, alone without your father
Alone, alone, and marching on

You never learn
(Never learn)
