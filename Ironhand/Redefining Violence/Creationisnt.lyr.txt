[v: 0.4 | 1]

I don't see it, even though my vision's pure
You can't prove this asinine hypothesis
You would have to invert the world to prove your faith
You call this logic? Because creation isn't

[r: Chorus]
Cast it down and mature
Childhood is behind you now
You know better, at least you should
Open your eyes and join the real world
[s:]

Logic, reason, not enough that walk this path
Your god is gone- nevermind, he wasn't here
Your eyes are fogged, inverted
You can't see past your own fear

Mindset maligned, insecure view of the world
Instant mankind? Heresy is proof enough
Instant universe from the mind of a ghostly fiend?
You call this true? Because creation isn't

[g: Chorus]
