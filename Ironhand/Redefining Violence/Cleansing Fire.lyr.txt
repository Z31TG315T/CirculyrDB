I can't stand you
And I can't stand me
No, I can't tolerate /
Anyone anymore

Behold this terror
Beyond your comprehension
Behold my anger /
As I call forth...

A cleansing fire [x2]

And that's when I wonder
Would I ask for death?
And that's when I realize
I ask for yours

I used to think /
That I walked alone
But soon I saw /
An army was behind me

If someone was listening /
I would pray
For a cleansing fire /
To rain down upon all

A cleansing fire [x3]
A cleansing fire upon you
