[v: 0.4 | 1]

Open up, here comes the answer you all seek
Why resist? I know this powers what you want
Do not cry, soon you'll know the power that is I
In my world you are a digit, nothing more

[r: Chorus]
And you cannot hear my voice /
All you hear are ones and zeros
And you cannot hear this sound /
All you're hearing is ones and zeros

Everything, everywhere /
Masses of just ones and zeros
And it's up to you my friend /
If you are a one or zero
[s:]

Feel these wires prying through what you call your own skin
Feel this current syncing with the lie you call your soul
Why do you run if you are everywhere at once and all?
Do you think that everything you have is here? And more?

[g: Chorus]
