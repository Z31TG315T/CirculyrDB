[p: C1] For everyone fears /
What lies behind the gates
But nobody knows /
What lies behind the gates [s:]

What lies behind the gates

[q: C1]
We can't comprehend /
What lies behind the gates
And now we shall find /
What lies behind the gates

The light was blinding to our eyes /
For we have never seen /
A truth so painful to behold
The masses writhe like worms
Their screams were music in my mind
It was they who sent me here
The few still standing tall now know /
The truth the sheep all fear

The strong will embrace /
What lies behind the gates
The weak will succumb /
To what lies behind the gates
The light of this world /
Is what lies behind the gates
And now we all know /
What lies behind the gates
