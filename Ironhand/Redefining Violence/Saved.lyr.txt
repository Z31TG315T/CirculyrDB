Speak to me of spirits, there's one thing I will say
Religion is a cancer, logic chemotherapy
[p: V1] Label me a heathen and tell me I'm depraved
You call me a sinner? I'm the only one saved! [s:]

Speak to me of god, there's one thing that I know
He's a criminal colossus and his time has come to go
[q: V1]

Do you really want to know this truth?
Would you really want to see this clear?
Do you really want to come this far?
Would you really want to end your fear?
[x2]

Speak to me of faith, there's one thing to be said
I don't believe in rewards I earn only when I'm dead
[q: V1]

Speak to me of warnings, there's one thing I will tell
Your threats are not amusing and I am not scared of hell
[q: V1]

And I know [x3]
And I know...

That I am not a child and I am not gullible
And I will not participate in something so horrible
Don't tell me I'll regret it, don't tell me to repent
I'll tell you you're pathetic until all my breath is spent

Speak to me of Satan, there's one thing you will see
His flock is much more civil than the Lord's could ever be
[q: V1]

Speak to me of logic, there's one thing I will share
Of all the faithful in the world, there isn't any there
[q: V1]
