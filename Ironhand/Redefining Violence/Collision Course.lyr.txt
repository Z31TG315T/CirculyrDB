I say this is no /
Single-sided mirror
It only takes one stone /
For you to see through clearer
So go and take a look
Who do you hold dearer?
I guess you can't see through /
A double-sided mirror

[r: Chorus]
You keep running away
And I end this today
I'm on a collision course [x2]
You keep pointing the blame
But you share it the same
I'm on a collision course [x2]
[s:]

You've all had your chance in the past
Failure could not be better told
Give evil a good name? It doesn't work
Like when we followed him

I try to convince clouded eyes
"Time to see the reality"
And why should I say that, anyway?
It's not like you listen after all

[g: Chorus]
