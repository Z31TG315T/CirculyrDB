Die!

[r: Chorus]
It's an experiment
It's an experiment in bludgeoning
[s:]

No I will not look, I'll...

[p: V1] Tear off your skin and pry out your bones
And not even God knows how far I can go [s:]
I care not for morals, I care not for you
And not even God knows how much I will do [x2]
And nor does he care
The murder of feeling, the terror of death [x4]

[g: Chorus]
[x2]

It's an experiment in pain

[q: V1]
Nor does he care, he's so
Cold [x6]

[g: Chorus]
