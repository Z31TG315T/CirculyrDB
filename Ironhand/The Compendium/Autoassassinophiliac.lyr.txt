Tears and cutting, bleeding to get you high
Getting off on watching your loved ones cry
Make your pain contagious, I wonder why /
The selfish like you hardly ever do...

Die [x7]
Die [x6]
Ever do die

You feel so cold
Naught but a social virus

I've got something for you bitch, so open wide
Cold steel pain, designed to explode inside
You're so damn weak, you'd go this far just to hide /
By squashing your pain like an insect with suicide
Just...

Kill yourself [x3]
Do the world a favour and /
Kill yourself [x3]
Die, die!
Kill yourself [x3]
Is that really what you want? To /
Kill yourself [x3]
Die, die!

Just fucking die!
I wonder why /
You want to die?
Maybe it's a lie

I'll come and make you, come and bring you /
Higher than before
I'll come and make you, come and bring you /
The attention that you crave [x2]
