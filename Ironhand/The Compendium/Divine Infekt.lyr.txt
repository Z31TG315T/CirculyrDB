[v: 0.4 | 1]

(We all deserve a life in hell)

[r: Verse]
RIP your god, fuck hopeless /
Self-anti-love you hold dear
Douse yourself in evil thoughts
Repressions of your fear

Darkness likes to toy with you /
As you walk through the night
Pillage through your conscious mind
The epidural blight
[s:]

[r: Chorus]
Feeding my anguish
This life born of pain
Deleted memory
This world's gone mad
[s:]
[x2]

(We all deserve a life in hell)
