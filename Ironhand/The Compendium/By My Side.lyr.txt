[v: 0.4 | 1]

Time to take my final breath
So eager to taste death
It's not that I'm so keen to leave
But there's daggers every time I breathe

Fire coursing through each vein
When it stops, then, so will the pain
A fiend for morphine, more
More morphine, if you please

Dying [x2]

[p: C1] I'm okay
I'll be okay with you here by my side
Dying [s:]
But I've no fear with you here by my side
[p: C2] Crying
Shed no tears, for you're here by my side /
With me [s:]
And do not leave until I leave you first

Don't waste your words on prayers
Chances are there's no-one there
Very soon I'll have my peace
And answers to all mysteries

Whether it's a man in white /
Or the keeper of hell's light /
Or even if nothing at all /
Exists to bind me to a soul

I leave you everything
I leave you all my nothing
Keep safe my memory /
For soon that's all I will be
Soon that is all that I will be [x2]

Dying [x2]

[q: C1]
I have no fear with you here by my side
[q: C2]
And do not leave until I leave you... (first)

[q: C1]
But I've no fear with you here by my side
[q: C2]
And do not leave until I leave you first
