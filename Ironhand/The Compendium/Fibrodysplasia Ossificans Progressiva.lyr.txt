If God was an artist
I'm sure that he would consider you his /
Finest of sculptures

If God was a monster
I'm sure he'd use an innocent like you /
As unwilling canvas

(You are so beautiful) [x2]

You dig in with your roots of bone /
As they twist and turn to stone
The art behind what he has grown /
Is finer than which man has known
