[r: Chorus 2]
I watch you lie to what's within
And I want to sin so much harder
[s:]

[r: Chorus 1]
To stray away is heresy
To speak against is sin
Your words will damn you as mine have I
But I can teach you where to begin
[s:]

[g: Chorus 2]
[x2]

So much harder

(I alone have done what no man has been able to do)
(I have taken the next step in our evolution)
(I have become king and god!)

[g: Chorus 1]
[x2]

[g: Chorus 2]
[x2]

So much harder
