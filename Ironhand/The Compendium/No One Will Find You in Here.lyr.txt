[v: 0.4 | 1]

[r: Chorus]
(He whispers)
[p: C1] No-one will find you in here
You're all gonna die in here [s:]
(We hear him whisper)
[q: C1]
[s:]

Chains are wrapped circling 'round
Glistening half moons surrounding here (No-one will find you in here)
(You're all gonna die in here)
Ears are pressed against the wall
Wishing for echoes of a friend (No-one will find you in here)
(You're all gonna die in here)

And he's coming near
It is what I feared, we're alone
And he's almost here
It is what I feared, there's no hope

[g: Chorus]
[x2]

(He whispers)
(We hear him whisper)
