This is the very last time
This will be your very last breath
Soon death will bring you the comfort that I /
Refuse to when I choose to abuse you, then lose you to...

Blood loss - smearing it across the walls as you flee from me
'Cause instinct tells you that's what's best to be
But the rest of me flies high, right at your /
Heels as you're running from the...

Scene of the crime, but now is the time that /
I stay back just a little bit on purpose
I'm doing it to give you a hope, a chance
But I'm afraid it's just a dance of... (death)

Death of another, soon I will smother /
Myself in your grief, no relief
No beliefs can save you from the grave you're digging for yourself
Here's a bit of advice

[p: C1] You'd better run faster than legs can carry
You'd better run faster than your legs can carry [s:]

(Let's dance)

It's time we heard a bit of jubilant murder
My aim's to hurt, or maim, or worse; afraid /
I can't contain the pain you're gonna gain /
As your screams get lost in the rain

Oh look! All of your insides are now on the outside
Now they're on the far side of the room
Ain't it quite a boon that you'll be dead soon?
Can't you tell that you're totally doomed?

Yeah, I'm a bit eccentric, guess you could call me sick
But here I am the shrink, and I have the /
Prescription to boot, one hundred ccs of /
Horrible death for you!

Be sure to take it with a glass of water /
And a side of horror 'cause you've no tomorrow
And you've also no skin; rip out what's within
Get you nice and thin, so let's begin!
