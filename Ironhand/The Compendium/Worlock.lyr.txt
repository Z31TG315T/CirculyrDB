(Now is the only thing that's real)

Binge, cringe (The police used to watch over the people, now they're watching the people)
Sloppy (Binge, cringe)
(Now is the only thing that's real)
Sloppy, mincing
Eye-dropping
Biopsy

Cyclops overlooks
Optic options
Rotten
Showstopper
Skin-popper

Babbler-dabbler
Self-confessed criminal
Tore pen in vain
Instant still spellbound

Game stock, talk-back rock
Re-encounter incident
Subsistence is inexistent (Now is the only thing that's real)

Non-committed
Unwitted, oblivious
Habitual resistor

Roughed-up edge, fluent nudge
Recollect ignition
Motivation inexistent

Wasted views
That's all they see, blue
Hot blood, guilt
Optic nerve

With the right attitude
You will succeed, blue
Self-abusive recluse
Too late for me

Make-shifting
Peace unsettling
Crazy doing crazy things

Keep your eyes open
Soft spoken changes nothing
A view so cruel
A view...

Dog's body comatose
Torchlight roast
Disinterest
Disinfect

Retold, impressed /
By possession
Insiders know refresh
Detained, contest

All that is pure
Sure tonight
Freeze in time and shadows climb
Distractions override

Instincts evolve
Over and over
Why can't you see this?

(Do you, don't you want me to make you?)
(Coming down fast but don't let me break you)
(Only tell me, tell me the answer)
(You may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer)

Wasted truth
Why call at all, blue
Hot lines
Eventual decline

With the right attitude
You will succeed, blue
Resent that discontent
Sidestep

Define
The state of things so far
Crazy things
Soft spoken, override

With your eyes open
You know, soft spoken changes nothing
A view so cruel
Nothing

(A view so cruel) [x6]

(Now is the only thing that's real)
