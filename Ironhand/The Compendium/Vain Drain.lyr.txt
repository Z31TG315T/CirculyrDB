(Hello, handsome!)
(You're a good looking fellow, do you know that?)
(???)
(???)
(You wanna talk about physical strength?)
(Do you want to talk about sheer muscle?)
(Do you want to talk about the Olympian ideal? You are a god)

How long has the mirror lied to me?
Just how deep is the sick inside of me?
What's the prescription? A new decision?
Or, cut off my face and what is left of me?

My intentions are not to hurt it
My imperfections are so perfect
Shattered vanity? Apparently what I need
I plant the seed and let it grow in me

[r: Chorus]
There is no point to try to explain the pain /
Or contemplate what little I had gained
Humility can keep my ego sane
Perhaps it's time for me to drain the vain
[s:]
[x2]

[p: B1] Vain drain
(Vain drain) [s:]

A coat of paint, or cloth to dim their sight
The surface lies, betraying inner light
And who I am is not a face or smile
Personal power makes us all worthwhile

So if you doubt the words that I convey
Just go ahead and hide what makes us great
And you will rot, and beauty surely fades
And I will not, and shine with blinding rays

[g: Chorus]
[x2]

(Vain drain)
