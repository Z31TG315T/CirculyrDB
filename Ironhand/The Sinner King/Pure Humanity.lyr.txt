Holding you /
Is grasping ice that's melting
Touching you
Rake my fingers across velvet
Restraining you
So easy to go too far
Choking you
It's so hard to hold myself back

All you do /
Makes me shiver like a tree in winter
All you say /
Makes me crawl through the hole a little deeper
What I want /
Is every piece of you and more
What you want /
Is to be left ravaged like a whore

I look at you and see
Something I can never be
Something that is gone from me
That pure humanity
[x4]
