Who would you pray for?
They're inside my hate
Here to stay
It keeps growing every day, 'cause /
This shit's useless
Those men lie to you /
Through and through
'Cause you're weak and don't know what to do

And this world keeps on burning

[p: V1] My eyes see clear, they know one thing
Despite all wounds you all keep marching on [s:]
But still you reek of hesitance
Reluctance for repentance, still clinging to innocence

Terminal permanence
Eternal residence
Shit-licking sycophants
This shit is evidence

I lack the heart I'd stab you through
As well as I'd never say one prayer for you

[p: C1] Why would you fight when there is no cause?
Why would you sing when you're spitting lies?
Why would you dance when you're crumbling down? [s:]
Why would you pray when there is no god?
[x2]

[p: V2] A hoping heart with a lemming mind
The vaporous god no-one can find
Refuse to progress alongside time [s:]
(You bleed this blood for nothing)

[p: V3] "We're not alone," you tell yourselves
But alone- alone is what you are
Alone, alone without your father [s:]
Alone, alone, and marching on

[q: V1]

Tell me...

[q: C1]
Why would you pray when there is no god?
[q: C1]
Why would you pray when there is no god? (Why would you pray, there is no god)

[q: V2]
(There is no god)

[q: V3]
Alone, alone and marching on (There is no god)

You never learn
