(The world came into existence)
(And there arose a builder)
(His will was like water, his hands were of iron)
(And he built a grand factory /)
(Where all his children would be born)
(And become enslaved)

[s: Chorus 1]
Lies are born and soldiers forged
Recruitments of reassurance whores
It's here they are made in my factory

Poisoned with theistic plague
Awaiting, still, their judgement day
It's here they are made in my factory
[r:]

(The vicar sees them on their knees)
Praying to nothing and their labour fuels his will /
To spread his love for us all

Yet no, they always say no, needles on the floor
Unlock the door to obedience
Now spread his love for us all

These lies have been born, these soldiers are forged
This battalion of mannequins cannot be ignored
It's here they are made in my factory

The Jesuit cried, their potential then died
And everything that followed is my beautiful crime
It's here the faithful prayed in my factory

(In these cyclic minds come hate, to call me reprobate)
But they're always late, it's already done
Manufacture, malevolence
And the cycle of hate comes full circle

[g: Chorus 1]

Wove to serve the sinner king
And any blight that he may bring
It's here you were made in my factory
