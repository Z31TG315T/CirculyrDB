[v: 0.4 | 1]

[r: Chorus]
How easy they fall into holy violence
Belief is the law, absolute compliance
[s:]

[r: Verse 1]
So tell me you're pure, tell me you're brave
Tell me I'm heathen and need to be saved
You're nothing but weak, you pathetic whore
I'll give you your rapture, the end-times, and more
[s:]

[r: Verse 2]
Show me this "father", show me a god
If he has such power it shouldn't be hard
Beating your bibles don't mean a thing
So throw down your hammer and prove it to me!
[s:]

And as they fall they're praying to me [x4]

[g: Chorus]
[x2]

My world
My home
My tomb
There is no place for you

Crack the earth
Smash the stars
Boil the sea
Forever more
[x2]

[g: Chorus]
[x2]

[s: Verse 1]

[s: Verse 2]
[x2]

Prove it to me!
Show me your god!
