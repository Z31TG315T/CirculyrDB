[v: 0.4 | 1]

Wake up, for his servant draws near
Wake up, who devours our fear
And so the rivers turn to blood before our eyes
And so locusts will come as another christ rises

[r: Pre-chorus]
Perhaps in another world
In another time
In a different place
He would be a brighter man /
With a better plan /
For this bitter race
[s:]

[r: Chorus]
And still you will see this world ends with me
He is the vicar of this age
His reign is about to begin
We watch your race die in record time
He is the vicar of this age
His master, the king of sin
[s:]

Vicar

One by one, they have all come running
Two by two, just to feed the crown
His servant is toiling
We greet his master in burial gown

His fish are flailing, gasping
Marionettes call my words disgrace
And I blaspheme by laughing
And spitting in his face

[g: Pre-chorus]

[g: Chorus]

Vicar

In the beginning there was nothing
And in the end there will be my wrath
Satan screams at the thought of me
And clamours to join the holy path

Their ashes will make mortar for my stone
Flesh will fuel fire to light this land
Their bones will do well to adorn my gates
And raping who rests on God's right hand

[g: Chorus]
