Perhaps I'll get to leave this place
This clean white room will let me know
So glad to see the masked man's face
The looks in their eyes tell me so

[r: Verses 2 and 3]
I never fit in with your kind /
So I will leave you all behind
I never want to be here again, here again

You built my world upon your lies
And everything that I despise
I pray I'll never see here again, here again
[s:]

Hand me the scalpel, his pulse has dropped
His blood pressure's down, let's get it back up
The tongs on the tray, what is the feed?
Look at the monitor, see what it reads
What should we do? We'll do what we can
We're wasting our time on this bitter young man
But nobody cares and neither do we
Let's give him some mercy and just let him sleep

Wait...

Don't touch his heart, look in his eyes
He's DNR, just let him die
[x2]

[g: Verses 2 and 3]

My time is here, my hour's late
I've had my day, so let me fade
Do not resuscitate

How long was I here? Way too long
We'll see who's right, we'll see who's wrong
Do not resuscitate
