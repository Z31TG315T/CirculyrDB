Countless souls around me
Not one of them is worth my while
I have to kill a million people
Just to crack this smile

[p: C1] I mean to end your lies
I will not compromise
I mean to open eyes [s:]
Unveiling terrorize now!

These unfamiliar faces /
Say cold things into my ear
And all you've called disgraces /
Is only what you've feared

[q: C1]
Unveiling terrorize
[p: C2] I mean to burn the skies
Rejoice in your demise
Sung in by mankind's cries [s:]
Unveiling terrorize

Help me find a way around my hate [x2]

The countless souls around us
Not one of them is worth our while
Would you kill a million people
Just to crack a smile?

All my tears /
Won't stop me from this day
And with all my tears /
I wish there was another way

[q: C1]
Unveiling terrorize
[q: C2]
Unveiling terrorize

No, there is no wall tall enough to hold back /
The force behind what I call terrorize
There is no life to record the event
And motive behind what becomes terrorize!
