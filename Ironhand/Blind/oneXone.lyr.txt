Terrorize!

One by one, they all come running
And two by two, they will all fall down
As for the third, his hate grows stronger
And makes a smile of his frown

Terrorize is coming
Not enough bullets for them all
One by one, they're running
And at the dawn he will watch them fall

One by one by / [x7]
One by one

My anger is a prism
My hate is blinding light
I shower the world in negatives for my positive delight

One by one, they all come running
And two by two, they will all be hushed
As for the third, his patience dwindles
And with a wave they will all be crushed

Terrorize is coming
He digs a mass grave for them all
One by one, they're running
And in due time he will watch them crawl

One by one by / [x7]
One by one

This world is just a coffin /
For everything alive
I have only but one lid to close
And no-one sees the dawn after this night

Terrorize!
