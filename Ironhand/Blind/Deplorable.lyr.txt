Baring glaring eyes
But blind anyway
Baring hearing ears /
That filter logic's glory
[p: V1] Their fascination /
Is so intolerable
They make me vomit
They are deplorable [s:]

[r: Chorus]
[p: C1] They build their roofs of dead wood
They build their walls of dead stone
They build their dreams of dead thoughts [s:]
We come singing, crying back to life

[q: C1]
I pull their skins from their dead bones shrieking
[s:]

Baring immense hate /
For that which contradicts
Call mankind's progress /
Just a mere nuisance
[q: V1]

[g: Chorus]

(I pull their skins from their dead bones shrieking) [x3]
They are deplorable
