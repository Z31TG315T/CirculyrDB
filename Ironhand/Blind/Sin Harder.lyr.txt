Instinct repressed
Obedience stressed
Fairytale truths, logical lies
All of their scriptures are a barrier for what's inside

Human soul lost
Acceptance gained
Your vendetta, holy nation
God is the prize of self-deprivation

They pray to rise up /
From the hell-hole /
That they call faith
They wallow in the falsified!

They pray to rise up /
From the prison /
They call morals
And pray for sodom when they die!
When they die

(Do we live for the moment, or delay paradise for when we're dead?)

To stray away is heresy
To speak against is sin
Your words will damn you as mine have I
But I can teach you where to begin

[r: Chorus 2]
I watch you lie to what's within
And I want to sin so much harder
[x2]
[s:]

(Do we die for the uncertain, or live for the guaranteed?)

[p: B1] Nothing I could ever do /
Will be good enough for him
And nothing I could ever say / [s:]
Will be true enough for me

[g: Chorus 2]

[q: B1]
Will be true enough, true enough for me

I want to sin so much harder!
