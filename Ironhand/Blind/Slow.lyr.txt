I wish I could hide behind these times
Go laughing when I die
I wish I could repent my crimes
Go laughing when I die

And you feel so cold [x2]

I wish that could know /
How you've lasted this long
And I wish I could know /
Where the hell that I went wrong

I burn you, I starve you, keep asking for more
I kill you, I rape you, keep begging for more
You war and you torture, you're praying for more?
And praying and praying?

If you weren't weak you would have discarded me
If you weren't blind I wouldn't be what you see
I thank you for what I am today
I've got hate and slaughter on my resume

You say it's a sin, whatever you do /
You kill for me more than you kill for you
Recruit your children, or tell them they'll burn
It's not my fault that you're so slow to learn

I'm not your excuse [x4]
