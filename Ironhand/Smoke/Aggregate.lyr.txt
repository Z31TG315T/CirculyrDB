Don't speak of forgiveness while singing of his wrath
Don't speak of bigotry as you force your holy path

[r: Chorus 1]
Stir the sky, shake the land
You're crushed beneath my iron hand
From the Vatican to the Taliban
You're crushed beneath my iron hand
[s:]
[x2]

Don't speak of purity when your hands are dripping red
Don't speak of eternity when you're scared of being dead

[r: Chorus 2]
I know you're after it, to feel immaculate
I'll crush your bones into aggregate
[s:]
[x2]

What's your faith made of?
I'm killing in the name of /
Heresy, lunacy
Progress of humanity

As you pray, you decay
Rot until your judgement day
I aspire for what's higher
Bring our race out of the fire

And you twitch, as I stitch /
Don't you feel that little itch /
Of doubt inside? Open wide
There's nowhere for lies to hide

Temples fall, churches burn
What's it take for us to learn?
Molten rubble left from it
Ground up into aggregate

[g: Chorus 2]
[x2]

And I will make you new
And you yourself are risen /
From the ashes of the old
And you shall be forgiven

Into aggregate [x4]

[g: Chorus 2]
[x2]

[g: Chorus 1]
[x4]
