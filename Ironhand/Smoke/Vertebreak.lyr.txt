[p: V1] Disable your limbs
Dance for me, baby
You're a marionette
Sever your nerves
And dance for me, baby / [s:]
All the way down the stairs

[p: V2] It can't end now
No, it can't end now
It can't end now
No, no! [s:]

[q: V1]
All the way down the stairs [x4]
No, no!

Oh, no, no
'Cause I'm not satisfied
Oh, no, no
See, I'm not satisfied
Oh, no, no
Oh, I'm not satisfied
Oh, no, no
Not until you have died
[x2]

[q: V2]
