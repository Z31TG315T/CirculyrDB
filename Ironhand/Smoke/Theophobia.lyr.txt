How I wish that I could be like you /
To have some hope I could cling to
Despite the comfort you may feel
In no way does it make him real

Though my actions may be strange
Perhaps my envy is to blame
And even though we're all the same
My theophobia's unchanged
[x2]

Oh how I wish that I was wrong
How I wish you fools were right
