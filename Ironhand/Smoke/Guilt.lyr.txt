[v: 0.4 | 1]

(What have I done?) [x2]

[r: Verses 1 through 4]
Pieces of flesh, under my nails
Blood in the creases upon my hands
Rust on my skin, dirt in my hair
Surrounded by condemning contraband

The bodies are gone, scattered like dust
Now is the time for me to pray
The approaching dawn, the night almost gone
The tears of the families will keep me awake

Shut the fuck up! No-one will know
They cannot accuse what they will not see
What do you know? What can you give?
Nothing of use to a monster like me

Now leave me alone, your words are a plague
I'm staying right here to rot within
Your punishment's naught, I've got my own hell
I'm mummified in a cocoon of my sin
[s:]

No, No! Please go away!
Why, why!? Leave me alone!
[x2]

[r: Chorus]
Oh no, another tried to run away
Oh no, another that I couldn't save
[x2]

These beginner sinners are nothing like me
My art is a sign of my dark mastery
[x4]
[s:]

(They had no idea of what he would do)
(Nobody listened) [x3]
(What have I done?)

(They welcomed him into their homes and gave him every opportunity)
(There were no words to describe what was found the next day)
(What have I done?)

What have I done, what have I done? [x8]

[g: Verses 1 through 4]

What have I done?

(Nobody listened) [x6]

[g: Chorus]
