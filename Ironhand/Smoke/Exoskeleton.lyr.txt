I've got my hands upon your beating heart again
Dissect it piece by piece, in time
Your pulse will dwindle, mine accelerates
They don't have a word for what I am
They say...

That which you touch is the skin on my skeleton
But within lies a darker medicine
Swallow this pill so we can get high again
You lose your nerve and the fun can then begin

[r: Chorus]
You, my friend, tempted sin
Why did I begin again?
All you see is my exoskeleton
They couldn't tell I lied to them
My hands crawl inside again
All they know is my exoskeleton
[s:]

(It's my exoskeleton)

Creating beauty, romance divine
Now take a breath for the very last time

[g: Chorus]

(Exoskeleton) [x2]
