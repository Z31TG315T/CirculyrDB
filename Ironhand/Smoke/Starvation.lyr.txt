[r: Chorus]
Embrace starvation
There's nothing left of you to save
[s:]

There's nothing left of you to save

[r: Verse 1]
Ribs jagged, skin ragged
Vomit, dust and desperation
Mouth drying, hope dying
Imminent of your starvation
[s:]

[r: Verse 2]
So frail, skin pale
Organs churn, remind you of your doom
Insane, such pain
You look like the corpse you will be soon
[s:]
