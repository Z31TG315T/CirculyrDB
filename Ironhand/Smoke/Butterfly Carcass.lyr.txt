I ain't no motherfucking butterfly
I've come to learn I will always be this worm, futile for me to try
I'm here in the dark while you're pointing your eyes up at the sky
You may metamorphosize, but I won't, and do not ask me why

I ain't no motherfucking butterfly
It's something you always knew, don't even bother to try to lie
There's no room for compromise; I'm happy down in my hole inside
You may metamorphosize, but I won't, and you know damn well why
Squirm!
