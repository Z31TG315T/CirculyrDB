[p: V1a] Here I come, for you've just sealed your fate
And I need you, my art must procreate

Time for the end of the human race [s:]
[p: V2a] Why, just look at your face
Your brand of fear's so commonplace [s:]

You've no choice, come with me
Glory comes to those who see
You've no choice, come with me
Hasten your apologies

Time for the end of the human race [s:]
[q: V2a]
