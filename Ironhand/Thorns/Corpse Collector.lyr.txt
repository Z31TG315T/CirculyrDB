Thirteen fingers lining the doorway
A severed hand points the way for us
Chimes of ribs dancing in the window

Everything is neat, everything is clean [x4]
He rolls out the red carpet for me

He never tells me what he does with them
He'll never tell us what he does with them
[x2]

Corpse collector, resurrector
Bring them back to life [x3]
Right now
[x2]
