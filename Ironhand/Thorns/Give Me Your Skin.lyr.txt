Give me your skin and /
I will take you there
Share all your sin and /
I will prove I care

Give me your skin
Share all your sin with me

Feel your hide, your body's purpose /
To crawl inside and elevate us
Fingernails painting pictures
Messages in flesh

Won't you share all of your sin with me?

Giving all that I'm holding
Sharing all that I am now
Soon, we both will be flying
Raising that which we are on high

Clasp my fingers and hold on well
We shall escape our living hell
And on we dance, in mortal sin /
Until we both grow cold again

Give me your skin [x4]
