It is time

Liar!
I would never be rescued by you
You have got your own ropes to unbind
Sing of revelations unravelled like your mind

Swimming in holy fascination
Your words have no power here
Take your salvation that's wrapped up in your fear
And plant it in the dirt to die

'Cause it's a lie
It's been a lie
All this time
It's been a lie
So here's some truth

Growing something that's stronger than /
What had came before the corruption
We have outgrown what many can't
Let go and I shall show you, show you a brighter path

And thinking of what they say
And questioning what they say
Immune to all that they say
We're growing through this, day after day

Surpassing what they became
Creating and being born
Disarmed with a will of thorns
We'll save a million with this sword

A million with this sword

The light of this
I strive for this
I fight for this
I die for this!
