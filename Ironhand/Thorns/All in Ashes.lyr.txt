[v: 0.4 | 1]

Pulling the worst part of me from my heart
Feed all my malice to mankind

I pull the last tree from on high /
And carve a cross to crucify
I raise my hands up to the sky
The clouds then part and we all die

No-one is safe, no-one is saved
Ignored are all the prayers you made
Yet they all still cling to their faith

[p: C1] Each one of you reduced to ash
The lives of men can never last [s:]
[p: C2] Reverse psycho logic
Hollow caustic, feed my will
And when the world's undone / [s:]
I'll have but one more to kill

They bled for days as rain came down /
And washed all their blood away
Yet they all still clung to their faith

Each one of you reduced to ash
Not one of you will see this pass
[q: C2]
I'll have but one god to kill [x3]

Is this what you prayed for?

[q: C1]
[q: C2]
I'll have but one more to kill [x2]

Rain through my fingers, wash all their blood away
Raising my hands high, silence their prayers today
Rain through my fingers, wash all their tears away
Raising my hands high, silence my prayers today
Rain through my fingers, wash all the blood away
Raising my hands high, end all their prayers this day
