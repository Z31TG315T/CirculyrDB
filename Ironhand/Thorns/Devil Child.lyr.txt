[r: Verse 1]
They call her devil child
Getting high in the womb
They call her devil child
And they'll smother that fucker soon

They call her devil child
Face like a shotgun suicide
They call her devil child
But she's an angel deep inside
Where no-one can see
[s:]

[p: C1] No-one's gonna love you with a face like that
No-one's gonna look at you and smile
No-one's gonna love you with a face like that
Echoing our innocence defiled [s:]

You see, some are just as ugly
But their scars cannot be seen
They could dig deeper into you
But what they find inside won't make them scream

[q: C1]
But it makes no difference to you /
At all

[g: Verse 1]
