[p: C1] Give me all you hold inside you
For I've not a thing within
Wrap your bloody arms around me
Show me what it's like to feel alive [s:]

[p: C2] Touching, breathing
Grasping, being
Holding, controlling
Smouldering at my heel now [s:]

Give me all you hold inside you
For you've not a choice at all
Widen your eyes, begin your fleeing
Show me what it's like to feel alive

Go on, my child
I'll follow you with shivers in my hand
My smile, hides nothing from /
Your frantic backward glance
This trial is insurmountable, unaccountable
No flowers are placed for those /
Whose shattered husks will never be found

The master is here
You'll never escape me
[x2]

You'll never escape me

[q: C2]

[q: C1]
To feel alive
No, no!

You didn't listen, did you, did you?
I didn't want to kill you, kill you
You were an angel, who could see them /
As if they had a soul inside

Their hearts, their minds
Broken like bread by /
Their scars, their crimes
And torn from the true will of man
And dragged from this life
Run away from me!
