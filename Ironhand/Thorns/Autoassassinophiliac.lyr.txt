Tears and cutting, bleeding to get you high
Getting off on watching your loved ones cry
Make your pain contagious, I wonder why /
The selfish like you hardly ever do die

You feel so cold
Naught but a social virus

I've got something for you bitch, so open wide
Cold steel pain, designed to explode inside
So damn weak, you'd go this far just to hide /
By squashing your pain like an insect with suicide
Just...

Kill yourself [x6]
Do the world a favour and /
Kill yourself [x6]
Die, die!

[p: C1] Kill yourself [x6]
Is that really what you want? To /
Kill yourself [x6] [s:]
Die, die, die!
Just fucking die!
I wonder why /
You want to die?
Maybe it's a lie

I'll come and make you, come and bring you
Higher than before
I'll come and make you, come and bring you
The attention that you crave [x2]

[q: C1]
Die!
