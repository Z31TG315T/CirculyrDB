Yes! I have you now
Restrained and contained and to my will you bow
Give me a taste of your unending pain
The cries behind duct tape get lost in the rain

This is my game
The winners and losers all remain the same
Like the times from before and ahead /
I will stay living, you'll soon be dead

This is not what I brought you here for
Oh no, this the end - I ask but one small thing of you, my friend
All I wish is for you to look me in the eye!
