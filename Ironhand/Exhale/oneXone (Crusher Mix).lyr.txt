Terrorize!

One by one, they all come running
And two by two, they will all be hushed
As for the third, his patience dwindles
And with a wave they will all be crushed

Terrorize is coming
He digs a mass grave for them all
One by one, they're running
And in due time he will watch them crawl

One by one by / [x7]
One by one

This world is just a coffin /
For everything alive
I have only but one lid to close
And no-one sees the dawn after this night

Terrorize!
