(And all creatures of this world shall become of ash)

(The very ground shall melt into an ocean of fire /)
(Before we are cast into the darkness)
(A tomb for everything once alive)
(A frozen rock to wander forever among the stars)

Swallow us in solar glory
Red giant! Ha!
Burn the world, erase our story

Red giant! Ha!

Red giant! Ha!
Bathed in light as all is burning
[s:]

Blessed with gifts, our lives erased
Swallow us in solar glory
[s:]

[p: B1] Come and take me, come and free me, carry me away [s:]
[x4]

Feel the fire, see the flares, taste the rapture in the air
(Feel the fire, see the flares, taste the rapture in the air)
[x4]
