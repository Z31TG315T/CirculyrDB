Crawl deep inside
Can you heal the scars in my mind?
Hiding from the fear of falling, I'm down my knees
All the wanting taken from me

[p: C1] Save me, come to me, my agony
Kill me, I am here, come set me free [s:]

Sever the ties
Separate the hurt in our minds
Can you see the light that blinds us, keeps us afloat?
Holding tightly, afraid to let go

[q: C1]
[p: C2] Break me, take me home and bury me where I belong
Away from it all [s:]

All is lost, lost in the pieces of this broken home
I can't hold on, leave me away from this world
Where I don't belong (I don't belong here anymore)
Where I don't belong

Save me, come to me, take everything
Kill me, I am here, come set me free
[q: C2]

Where I don't belong (I don't belong here anymore) [x3]
Where I don't belong
