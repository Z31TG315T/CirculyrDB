[v: 0.4 | 1]

Separate the life from me, it burns within my soul
Call me home and set afree the hurt that won't let go
Forgotten with no-one to remember me
I'm frozen, lost without a soul

[r: Chorus]
Into the light, the beautiful night
I'll follow the angels tonight
Sweet sorrow inside, take hold of my mind
I'll follow the angels tonight
[s:]

Guide me to my paradise, my love, for one last time
My sanctuary in the dark where all my fears collide
Forever enslaved by my uncertainty
I'm fractured, bleeding to my core

[g: Chorus]
[x2]
