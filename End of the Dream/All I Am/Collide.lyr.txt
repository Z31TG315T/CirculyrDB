[v: 0.4 | 1]

I remember breathing to the beat of your heart
I remember bleeding when you tore me apart
Is this all you've left of me?
'Cause it breaks my heart to see

[p: C1]
I feel our hearts collide (I feel our hearts collide)
When you sing the words and guide me with your melody [s:]
And I feel so alive (And I feel so alive)
So turn the page, create another memory
With me

Don't let go of hope, don't let them take who you are
Keep on going, stronger, and reach for the stars
Now your song is all I need
'Cause inside, you're just like me

[q: C1]
And I feel so alive (And I feel so alive)
So turn the page, create another memory

We were lost together, and falling through life
With no road to follow and no end in sight
I can still remember every dream you've left behind

I feel our hearts collide
When you sing the words and guide me with your melody
And we were so alive
So turn the page, create another memory

[q: C1]
And I feel so alive (And I feel so alive)
So turn the page, create another memory (When our hearts collide)

I feel our hearts collide
When you sing the words and guide me with your melody
Dreaming, believing, there's nothing left to hide (So turn the page, create another memory)
(Turn the page, create another memory) So turn the page, create another memory
