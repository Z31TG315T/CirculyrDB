[v: 0.4 | 1]

I am the darkness, the pain in your eyes
I am the reason there's nothing left inside
Won't give up, won't give in, I won't surrender to you
Screaming out, falling down as I lose myself in you

And now it's taking over (The darkness deep inside)
I feel it growing colder

You're my obsession, the reason I bleed
You're the infection that spreads inside of me
Can't deny, can't resist, I'm addicted to you
Pull me down, hit the ground, 'cause I've got nothing left to lose

And now it's taking over (Your darkness deep inside)
I feel it growing colder (It's taking me alive)
I feel it coming closer (And I'm next in line)
And now it's almost over
[x2]

(And now it's almost over) And now it's almost over
