[v: 0.4 | 1]

Darling, descend with me
Your soul lost and lonely
Come to me and I will /
Take you away

Darling, listen to me
I'm your one, your only
Don't defy me, let me /
Take you away

[r: Chorus]
Standing in the light to see the shadows it creates
Walk into the dark and wait for the shadow's sweet embrace
[s:]

Darling, I will wake you
Close your eyes and take you /
Underneath it all, where /
You come to life

Without the sin, the pain within
There is no shelter from the rain
Without belief, what do you see /
When the end is near?

[g: Chorus]

Fly away with me
On the wings of eternity to carry you on
There's nothing left to fear
This is where you belong

[g: Chorus]
