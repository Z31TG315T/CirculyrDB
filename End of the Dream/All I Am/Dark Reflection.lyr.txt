[v: 0.4 | 1]

Walking through darkness, a victim in need
Praying to God for salvation
Somewhere inside me a prisoner screams
Screams of destruction and madness

Godless collusions, betrayal and deceit
Living the lives of the broken
In search for the answer to cure the disease
Washing away all our misery

[r: C1] There's no need for redemption, our dreams are divine
To unlock our faith we will stand in line [s:]
[r: C2] We're all lost from within, but prepared for the fight
Baby, try to be strong and we'll be alright [s:]

I feel like nothing's ever real, like I'm supposed to be /
Someone else outside this dark reflection
How can I believe in me when something's always /
Smothering me so violently

[q: C1]
[q: C2]

The deepest hearts will know their fate
As they judge what they create
And all their deepest fears
Fall away

A moment's obsession is almost overthrown
A reason to live and die, to reap what you have sown
To make it through and realize you've forgotten who you are
You've lost yourself in oceans of lost memories and thoughts

We are lost for a moment in dreams so divine
With a dream of a nightmare in our hearts, confined
[q: C2]
