[v: 0.4 | 1]

Hopeless, this could be my last chance
Laying in a fading light, the cold of night comes over me
Dreamless, cherishing this last breath
Could I be alone in this one mortal wish to set her free
To close my eyes in peace

[p: C1] This is all I am, all I feel
All I believe inside
This is all I breathe, all I bleed [s:]
My only dream worth fighting for

Shiver, feelings crossing over
Crawling through the cracks of this abandoned mind and broken heart
Hold me, tell me I'm not broken
Tell me there's a way for us, a place for us to go away /
And start all over again

[q: C1]
My only dream worth fighting for

But I can't see through my dreams
What's laying awake on the other side

And nobody tried to save me
And nobody ever will be me
But something is coming for me
And in the end, I'll see it through with you
See through it all

[q: C1]
Something to keep my faith alive
Keep my faith alive
