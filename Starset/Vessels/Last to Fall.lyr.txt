And I fly further away
Than I've ever been before, it's safe to say /
This sky is lonely and grey
But every night I feel your gravity waves

And the world is cold, but it's beautiful
I wish you were here now, I miss you so
But you lost your light when the darkness called
I stand here waiting
The last to fall [x4]

And I fly above the enslaved
My soul is burning like an earth reclaimed
And I try a final crusade
This world is changing but I'm still the same

And will you be bold? Will you lose control?
I could never desert you, I could never let go
If you fall in line and the zenith calls
I'm standing, waiting
The last to fall [x4]

It's your magnetic hold, a gravity pull
I can feel you in waves
When your melody comes, it falls from above
I will not be afraid

The last to fall [x8]
