Under the knife I surrendered
The innocence, yours to consume
You cut it away
And you filled me up with hate

Into the silence you sent me
Into the fire consumed
You thought I'd forget
But it's always in my head

[p: C1] You're the pulse in my veins
You're the war that I wage
Can you change me? [x2] [s:]
[p: C2] You're the love that I hate
You're the drug that I take
Will you cage me? [x2] [s:]
[q: C1]
From the monster you've made me? [x2]

This is the world you've created
The product of what I've become
My soul and my youth
Seems it's all for you to use

If I could take back the moment /
I let you get under my skin
Relent or resist
Seems the monster always wins

[q: C1]
[q: C2]
[q: C1]
From the monster you've made me? [x2]

My heart's an artifice, a decoy soul
I lift you up and then I let you go
I've made an art of digging shallow holes
I'll drop the tiniest seed and watch it grow

My heart's an artifice, a decoy soul
Who knew the emptiness could be so cold?
I've lost the parts of me that make me whole
I am the darkness, I'm a monster

[q: C1]
[q: C2]
[q: C1]
From the monster you've made me? [x4]
