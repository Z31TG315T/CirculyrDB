Stardust in you and in me
Fuse us into unity
Primeval, we're coupled
Born from the universe

Farewell, the void is calling
Don't fear for our futures and dreams
They're fleeting, retreating
It's ok, I promise

I don't know what to say
But I'm gonna want you 'til the stars evaporate
We're only here for just a moment in the light
One day it shines for us, the next we're in the night
So say the word and I'll be running back to find you
[p: C1] A thousand armies won't stop me, I'll break through
I'll soar the endless skies for only one sight /
Of your starlight [s:]

Tell me, just tell me to stay
I'll turn, I won't look away
I'll stay here, I'll never go but you don't feel the same

Farewell, farewell and god-speed
Light years between you and me
I'm fading, your beauty conquers the darkness

[p: C2] At night the earth will rise
And I'll think of you each time I watch from distant skies
Whenever stars go down and galaxies ignite
I'll think of you each time they wash me in their light
And fall in love with you again
I will find you [s:]
[q: C1]

Don't leave me lost here forever
Show me your starlight and pull me through
Don't leave me lost here forever
I need your starlight to pull me through
(Bring me back to you) Bring me back to you

[q: C2]
[q: C1]
