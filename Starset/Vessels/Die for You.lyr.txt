I will run alone tonight
Without you by my side
I guess you had a place you had to get to

I know your eyes, I know inside
The walls you hide behind
And I saw the truth inside the real you

[p: PC1] Because I know you're lost when you run away
Into the same black holes and black mistakes
Taking all my will just to run alone [s:]
When are you coming home?

[r: Chorus 1]
Even if the sky does fall
Even if they take it all
There's no pain that I won't go through
Even if I have to die for you
[s:]

[r: Chorus 2]
And when all the fires burn
When everything is overturning
There's no pain that I won't go through
Even if I have to die for you
[s:]

One day the Earth will open wide
And I'll follow you inside
'Cause the only hell I know is without you

Some day when galaxies collide
We'll be lost on different skies
I will send my rocket ship to find you

[q: PC1]
Until I bring you home

[g: Chorus 1]
[g: Chorus 2]

And if the sun grows cold for you along the way
And if the stars don't align to light the way
And when you fall away and crash back down below
I'll search the skies for you and I'll follow
I'll be in your afterglow
And I'll bring you home

Even if the sky does fall
Even if they take it all
I can't see but I'll follow you
Even if I die

[g: Chorus 2]
