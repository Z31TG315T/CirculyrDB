There's a silent scene
As the machine arrives here
I feel it pulling me in
I feel the past that's died here

I hear it calling me
You can come alive here
I hear it beckoning
Until I am inside

[r: Chorus]
Riding the horizon
Falling into you
Feel the vessel tighten
I feel you pull me through

A new world is breaking
Your heart unveiling
Breaking into pieces
In the gravity of you [x2]
[s:]

I see the empty dreams
Race across the sky here
I see energy streams
Where the ashes lie here

I feel you here with me
When all the hope has died here
It's boring holes in me
Enough to get inside

[g: Chorus]

To fall in the star is to be nothingness
To escape is to be empty
Fall into the star and then we won't exist
Or escape into the nothing
[x2]

Your sky, the beauty alone is worth it
I- I will risk it all to own it

[g: Chorus]
