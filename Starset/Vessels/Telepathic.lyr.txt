And if I had my way
I would run to the rescue
It never works that way
When you call the bluff

Oh, all the fools rush in
It's a battle to surround you
And all the fools want in
But I'm not giving up

[r: Pre-chorus]
I don't wanna let you go
But I can't stand to watch this
I don't wanna let you know
But you can read my mind
[s:]

[r: Chorus]
I feel it all the time
Felt it all around you
You had me in your spell right from the start
I don't have a telepathic heart (Telepathic)

Blind, I fall into the line /
That's waiting just to get you
But I won't ever know just what we are
I don't have a telepathic heart (Telepathic)
[s:]

Look inside my brain
You'd know what I want before I tell you
Give me the words to say
To make it enough

Don't want your star-crossed fate
You are the sun, I am the full moon
Don't leave me lost in vain
I can be what you want

[g: Pre-chorus]
[g: Chorus]

And you always turn away
Back to the start where I break through
You can run, you can run away
I will wait in the dark for you

Should've never felt this way
'Cause you're the sun and I'm just a moon
I'm in the dark 'til you light the way
'Cause I'm see through, you can read my mind

[r: Chorus]

(Telepathic) [x2]
