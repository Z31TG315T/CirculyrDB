Dislocated, self is fading
Falling back from what I was
Flying through existence, tumbling towards a burning sun
Something's screaming in the distance, telling me to come
It's calling me

Are you out there waiting?
I can hear it calling
It takes more than eyes to see
It's out in the energy but /
I can hear it calling

[r: Chorus]
Take the path less travelled
Face the darkness on my own
Into the starlight will I go
Until the end I will roam

Fate itself unravelled
Make the emptiness my home
Into the starlight will I go
Soaring into the unknown
[s:]

Suffocated, voice has faded
Is this real or in my mind?

(Are you out there waiting?)
I can hear it calling
It takes more than eyes to see
It's out in the energy but /
I can hear it calling

[g: Chorus]
[x2]
