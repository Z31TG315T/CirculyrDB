You come in waves 'til you're all I know
Then you fade away into nothing
Weighed down by dark matter inside
You leave me frozen, you leave me frozen in time
In your...

[r: Chorus]
Everglow, you'll never know /
The beauty I see when you open your shadows
Everglow, they'll never know /
The worlds that I see in the darkness you don't show
[s:]

Falling through a landslide
Feeling like the first time I felt you
Caught inside the field lines
That pull me to the land mines inside you
Black hole eyes won't gaze now
Drawn in just the same
You leave me frozen
You leave me frozen inside

[g: Chorus]
[x2]

Come, I'll show every ghost in me
Take my pain into you...
[x4]
