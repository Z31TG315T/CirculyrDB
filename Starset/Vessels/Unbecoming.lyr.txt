I lost myself into the night
And I flew higher
Than I had ever but I still felt small

I clipped my wings and fell from flight
To open water
And floated farther away from myself

And I swam in the wakes of imposters
Just to feel what it's like to pretend
There's no dreams in the lakes, only monsters
And the monsters are my only friends

They're all that I was
And ever could be

[r: Chorus]
Eyes in the dead still water
Tried, but it pushed back harder
Cauterized and atrophied
This is my unbecoming

Knives in the backs of martyrs
Lives in the burning fodder
Cauterized and atrophied
This is my unbecoming
[s:]

You found me drifted out to sea
It's automatic
It's telepathic, you always knew me

And you laugh as I search for a harbor
As you point where your halo had been
But the light in your eyes has been squandered
There's no angel in you in the end

And all that I was
I left behind me

[g: Chorus]

Now I wait, this metamorphosis
All that is left is the change
Selfish fate, I think you made me this
Under the water I wait

[g: Chorus]
