I saw it in your eyes
I saw the creature deep inside
You opened up your cage
Pathetic insect, drawn to flame

I'm falling apart inside your holographic heart
Lost souls dancing and now the lie's collapsing

[r: Chorus]
There's something inside you that isn't right
There's something that haunts your dreams at night
There's something that you have lost, and you're bringing it down
You're bringing it down on top of us
[s:]

I see the crimson thief
Hanging on heartstrings, dripping bleach
Victim with hands in sleeves
Your lying swan sings as I reach

I'm falling apart inside your holographic heart
Lost souls dancing and now the lie's collapsing

[g: Chorus]

Silly me, I thought I had it
I came so close this time
I knew your heart was plastic
I still thought I could make it mine

Surrender
You are mine
Your creature is inside
Devouring, devouring me alive

[g: Chorus]
