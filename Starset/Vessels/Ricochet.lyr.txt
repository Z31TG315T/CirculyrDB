And we were born over the world
We were flying through the satellites
We had a hold of the lightning strikes /
When we should've been afraid of heights

And I was trying just to get you
And now I'm dying to forget you
'Cause I knew I couldn't catch you
So I light the sky, and I fell behind

[r: Chorus]
We were one and the same
Running like moths to the flame
You'd hang on every word I say
But now they only ricochet

We were falling away
You left me with a bittersweet taste
And when I send my heart your way
It bounces off the walls you made
Ricochet
[s:]

???
I forget it and just walk away
'Cause I've been told that I'm dragging it out
And I've been dying just to see your face

And all I wanted was to say goodbye
To the fortress that you stood behind
And in the silence, now I realize
That, after all, I built the wall

[g: Chorus]

All these broken souls, they never make me whole
They don't, they don't know my heart
They don't know my heart

All these broken souls, ???
They don't, they don't know my heart
They don't know my heart

I'll send out my soul ???
They won't, they won't own my heart
It's the darkest part

[g: Chorus]
