Darkening skies coming this way
Falling behind into nothing
But if you lead, I will follow (A thousand miles away)
I will be your Apollo (Alone in outer space)

[r: Chorus]
Satellite, shine on me tonight
I will be your gravity, I will stay and never leave
My satellite, are you here tonight?
Shine your light and set me free, take the darkness out of me
Shine on me [x3]
[s:]

Blinded I wait, the end is forming
You are my fate, give me warning
If you lead, I will follow (A thousand miles away)
I will be your Apollo (Alone in outer space)

[g: Chorus]

Far across the emptiness, I walk the night
And search the silence in the dark you left behind
I seek the stars above the worlds to be the guide
But they all pale against the light in your eyes

And I won't suppose to know why you walked away
But can feel you pushing through beyond the space
So send your energy to me and I'll push through
Send your signal home and bring me back to you

[g: Chorus]
