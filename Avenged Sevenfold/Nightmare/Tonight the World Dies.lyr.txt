[v: 0.4 | 1]

Lost the meaning of our stay
Learned to live another day
Doubt the choices that we've made
I know that we can't hide our shame
It's only in disguise

Drowning in our own debris
Full of thoughts as though we're free
Close our eyes so we can see
The depth of all we mean to be /
If only in my eyes

[p: C2] I don't mind (Read the writing on the wall)
Mother cries (Tortured voices as we crawl)
Find me on my better days to lose it once again [s:]
In a way

So try and love me while you can
And take the time to understand
As long as I can touch your face
You know I'll never leave this place
If only in my mind

[q: C1]
[p: C2] But I seem to find no better ways to consciously pretend [s:]

Silence all I want to say
Tendencies to run away, I run away /
With you tonight
Launder all my sins away
And just like that mistakes are made, you know
Tonight the world (dies)
