(Total nightmare) [x2]

You wanna hear my side?
You need to drown to know
With all the times it hurt me to fuck you
I built a wall with your blood to show

(God save us)
(God save us all)
(God hates us)
(God hates us all)

(Total nightmare) [x2]

Nothing to heal, no-one to break
Pills had a role, now there's nothing to take
Nothing to trust, no-one to fake
You'll find out sooner that it's best if we just know our place

My infiltrated mind
My lacerated soul
It took me years, create me, control you
I left myself for an idea I stole

(God save us)
(God save us all)
(God hates us)
(God hates us all)

(Total nightmare) [x2]

(Lie, rape, kill)
(Love, hate, fear)
You better take your time, you better take it slow (Lie, rape, kill)
'Cause when you seek the one, There's nothing left to show (Love, hate, fear)

(Total nightmare) [x4]
