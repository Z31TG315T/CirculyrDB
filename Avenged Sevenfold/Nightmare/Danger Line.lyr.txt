[v: 0.4 | 1]

My sixteen locked and loaded
All fear has been avoided
You say the words and my weapon is drawn

This one could be my last time
Some people call it war crime
I may be staring down a lethal sight (To die)

[r: Chorus]
Nothing shocks you like a bullet hole
Leaving my fear on the danger line
Suffering no man should ever know
Leaving my faith on the danger line
[s:]

I do this for my family
My daughter loves her daddy
Too many talk down on things they don't know

With colors never faded
Reckless and unabated
They may take me, but never take us all (I'll crawl)

[g: Chorus]

I know what you're thinking, I've been there before

So think of the times
The time we spent laughing away
So think of the times
At home (Life without a care)

Now I find myself in my own blood (Never thought I'd lie in my own blood)
The damage done is far beyond repair
I never put my faith in up above (Never had much faith in up above)
But now, I'm hoping someone's there

I never meant to leave this world alone
I never meant to hurt the ones who cared
And all this time I thought we'd just grow old
You know, no-one said it's fair

Tell my baby girl that it's alright
I've sung my last song today, remind the /
Lord to leave his light on for me
I'm free
