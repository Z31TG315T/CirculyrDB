Skull

They all know [x2]

Sorry did I wake your dream? Some questions run too deep
We only- only wake up when we sleep
Led by the lunar light, trouble's all we'd find
Lost our way tonight

Is it something we said?
Is it something we said to them?
Is it something we said?

[p: C1] (Save me) I'm trapped in a vile world
(Save me) Where the end game's all the same as every other
We're only here to die
(Save me) I'm losing my only dream
(Save me) I could use some guiding light, some place to go [s:]
If you hear me let me know

They all know [x2]

Ever since the day you left my fate's been set unknown
How many years to walk this path alone?
So much to see tonight, so why'd you close your eyes?
Why can't I shut mine?

Is it something we did?
Is it something we did to them?
Is it something we did?

[q: C1]
If you hear me let me know [x2]

Help me find my way
I said, help me find my way

No pulse inside of me, stone cold lips and heresy
All lies and, to a degree, losing who I wanna be
You'll find out right now

He may be out of his mind but, someday, you will find
That sanity's left us all blind and dragged us all behind
A moment seen through those eyes, crystal-blue disguise
They say that all beauty must die, I say it just moves on

If you'd only open your mind then, someday, you will find
Insanity left us behind and walked right through the door
I can see the pictures clear as yesterday, pictures all my own
I can hear the voices begging you to stay, but know you're not alone

[q: C1]
If you hear me let me know [x2]

Tonight, we all die young [x6]
Tonight, we all die
Tonight, we all die young
