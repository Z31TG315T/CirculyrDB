One snap for the dying, one click to end the day
Another story with a mangled scene, it couldn't happen any other way
You wanna talk about it? I'm begging you to walk in my shoes any time
Watch the clock 'til you unwind
You wanna cry about it? It's making me consider that I lost my mind
The way I see, you must be blind

So, this is the world you left behind?
This is the guilt that consumes you?

[p: C1] So die alone
This is the one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you [s:]

Can't bribe me with money, can't shower me with shame
Another killer from a broken home until you come on me with manic fame
You wanna know about it? But Imma be fucking with you every time
Story broke and you're behind
Yeah, when you ask about it? You can rest assured I'll give you my best side
Seems we all have friends to find

So, this is the hate I've been born to?
Full of the tales of the untrue?

[q: C1]

And I'm waiting
Waiting for the days to slowly pass me by (And all the promises I'll find)
No hesitating
You pulled the trigger now your story's left behind (I know you wanna see me fry)
(Like my soul, you won't survive)

[q: C1]
To die unknown /
Would crush the fish lens we all see through
To kill the glare /
Expose the ugliness we hold true
