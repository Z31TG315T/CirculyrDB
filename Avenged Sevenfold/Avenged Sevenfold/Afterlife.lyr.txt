Like walking into a dream, so unlike what you've seen
So unsure but it seems ('Cause we've been waiting for you)
[p: V1] Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste /
Of your afterlife here, so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway [s:]

I see a distant light
But, girl, this can't be right
Such a surreal place to see, so how did this come to be?
Arrived too early

And when I think of all the places I just don't belong
I've come to grips with life and realized this is going too far

I don't belong here, we gotta move on, dear
[p: C1] Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right /
To move on and on
Far away from here [s:]

A place of hope and no pain, perfect skies with no rain
Can leave this place but refrain ('Cause we've been waiting for you)
[q: V1]

This peace on earth's not right (With my back against the wall)
No pain or sign of time (I'm much too young to fall)
So out of place don't wanna stay, I feel wrong and that's my sign
I've made up my mind

Gave me your hand, but realize I just wanna say goodbye
Please understand, I have to leave and carry on my own life

I don't belong here, I gotta move on, dear
[q: C1]
[p: C2] Got nothing against you, and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light
And I'd hoped you might /
Take me back inside /
When the time is right [s:]

Loved ones back home all crying 'cause they're already missing me
I pray by the grace of God that there's somebody listening
Give me a chance to be that person I wanna be (I am unbroken, I'm choking on this ecstasy)
Oh, Lord, I'll try so hard but you gotta let go of me (Break me, unchain me, I need another chance to live)

I don't belong here, I gotta move on, dear
