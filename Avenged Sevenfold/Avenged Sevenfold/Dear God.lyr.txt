[v: 0.4 | 1]

[p: V1] A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
Miles away from those I love, purpose undefined [s:]
While I recall all the words you spoke to me /
Can't help but wish that I was there and where I'd love to be, oh yeah

[r: Chorus]
Dear God, the only thing I ask of you is to /
Hold her when I'm not around, when I'm much too far away
We all need that person who can be true to you, but I /
Left her when I found her, and now I'm wishing I'd stayed

'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again, oh, no
Once again
[s:]

There's nothing here for me on this barren road
There's no-one here while the city sleeps, and all the shops are closed
Can't help but think of the times I've had with you
Pictures and some memories will have to help me through, oh yeah

[g: Chorus]

Some search, never finding a way
Before long they waste away
I found you, something told me to stay
I gave in to selfish ways

And how I miss someone to hold when hope begins to fade

[q: V1]

[g: Chorus]
