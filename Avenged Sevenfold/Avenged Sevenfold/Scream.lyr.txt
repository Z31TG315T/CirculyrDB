[v: 0.4 | 1]

Caught up in this madness, too blind to see
Woke animal feelings in me
Took over my sense and I lost control
I'll taste your blood tonight

[r: Pre-chorus]
You know I make you wanna scream
You know I make you wanna run from me, baby
But no, it's too late, you've wasted all your time
[s:]

Yeah

Relax while you're closing your eyes to me
So warm as I'm setting you free
With your arms by your side there's no struggling
Pleasure's all mine this time

[g: Pre-chorus]

[r: Chorus]
Cherishing those feelings, pleasuring
Cover me, unwanted clemency

Scream 'til there's silence
Scream while there's life left, vanishing
Scream from the pleasure
Unmask your desire, perishing
[s:]

We've all had a time where we've lost control
We've all had our time to grow
I'm hoping I'm wrong, but I know I'm right
I'll hunt again one night

[g: Pre-chorus]

[g: Chorus]

Some live repressing their instinctive feelings
Protest the way we're built, don't point the blame on me

Scream, scream, scream the way you would if I ravaged your body
Scream, scream, scream the way you would if I ravaged your mind

[g: Chorus]
