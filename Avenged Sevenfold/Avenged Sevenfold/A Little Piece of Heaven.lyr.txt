Before the story begins, is it such a sin /
For me to take what's mine, until the end of time?
We were more than friends, before the story ends
And I will take what's mine, create what God would never design

Our love had been so strong for far too long
I was weak with fear that something would go wrong
Before the possibilities came true /
I took all possibility from you

Almost laughed myself to tears
Conjuring her deepest fears (C'mere, you fucking bitch)
Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times, I can't believe it
Ripped her heart out right before her eyes, eyes over easy
Eat it, eat it, eat it

She was never this good in bed, even when she was sleepin'
Now she's just so perfect I've never been quite so fucking deep in

It goes on and on and on
I can keep you lookin' young and preserved forever /
With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever

[p: PC1] 'Cause I really always knew that my little crime /
Would be cold, that's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time
But bye-bye

And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun [s:]
Baby, don't cry

[p: C1] You had my heart /
At least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart
Let's make a new start [s:]
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah
But, baby, don't cry

Now possibilities I'd never considered /
Are occurring, the likes of which I'd never heard
Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave /
To repossess a body with which I'd misbehaved

Smiling right from ear to ear
Almost laughed herself to tears
Must have stabbed him fifty fucking times, I can't believe it
Ripped his heart out right before his eyes, eyes over easy
Eat it, eat it, eat it (Eat the shit out of it)

Now that it's done I realize the error of my ways
I must venture back to apologize, from somewhere far beyond the grave

I gotta make up for what I've done
'Cause I was all up in a piece of heaven /
While you burned in hell, no peace forever

[q: PC1]
But, baby, don't cry

[q: C1]
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah
But, baby, don't cry

I will suffer for so long (What will you do, not long enough)
To make it up to you (I pray to God that you do)
I'll do whatever you want me to do (Well then I'll grant you one chance)

And if it's not enough / (If it's not enough, if it's not enough)
If it's not enough / (Not enough)
Try again (Try again)
And again (And again)
Over and over again (And over again)

We're coming back, coming back
We'll live forever, live forever
Let's have wedding, have a wedding
Let's start the killing, start the killing

(Do you take this man in death for the rest of your unnatural life?)
(Yes, I do)
(Do you take this woman in death for the rest of your unnatural life?)
(I do)
(I now pronounce you...)

But, baby, don't cry
