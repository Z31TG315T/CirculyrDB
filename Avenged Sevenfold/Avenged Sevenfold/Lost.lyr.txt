[v: 0.4 | 1]

Centuries passed and still the same
War in our blood, some things never change
Fighting for land and personal gain
Better your life, justify your pain

The end is knocking [x2]

[r: Chorus]
We've all been lost for most of this life (Lost for most of this life)
Everywhere we turn, more hatred surrounds us
And I know that most of us just ain't right (Most of us just ain't right)
Following the wrong steps, being led by pride
[s:]

How many lives will we take?
How many hearts destined to break?
Nowhere to run, can't escape
Full of ourselves, tied to our fate

The end is knocking [x2]
Yeah

[g: Chorus]

With peace of mind so hard to find
We're dwelling on the drastic signs
Another way to numb our mind

And as you close your eyes tonight
And pray for a better life
You'll see it flying helplessly away

[g: Chorus]

(We've all been lost for most of this life)
(Everywhere we turn, more hatred surrounds us)
(And I know that most of us just ain't right)
(Following the wrong steps, being led by pride)
[x2]
