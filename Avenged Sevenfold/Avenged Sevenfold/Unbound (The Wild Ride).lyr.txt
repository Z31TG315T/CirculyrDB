Somewhere life is good, and things go as they should
It's hard to find, but that's alright, yeah, yeah
Searching for the way, push harder everyday
It's deep inside, that shining light, yeah, yeah

But I'm scarred by barriers placed in my path
I'm scathed

[r: Chorus]
This ride that takes me through life /
Leads me into darkness but emerges into light
No-one can ever slow me down
I'll stay unbound
[s:]

Sometimes when we're young, and always on the run /
It gets so dark; and I know that place, yeah, yeah
So don't be too concerned, you've got a lot to learn
Well, so do I, and we've got plenty of time, yeah, yeah

Don't fall off the track yet with so many races to go
Hold on

[g: Chorus]

Some live so wrong - with what we do, is each his own?
Living in fear, endless shame for countless years
I never lived in fear, I knew I'd die another day
I never viewed my life as something slipping away
[x2]

There's nothing here to take for granted /
With each breath that we take
The hands of time strip youth from our bodies
And we fade
Memories remain /
As time goes on
[x2]
