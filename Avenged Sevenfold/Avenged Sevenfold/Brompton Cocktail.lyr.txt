(Out of time)

Doc, I'm dying
I'm feeling compromised, and so dehumanized (Feeling compromised, so dehumanized)

I've lost my final fight to disease
I feel that this is where it ends
I need that shot to enter my vein
My Brompton cocktail blend

[r: Pre-chorus]
'Cause I can't feel my face
I won't struggle on
In a world so cold
In a world so wrong
[s:]

[p: C1] I'm not running away
Been fighting this so long (So long)
Such a price that we pay
We gotta be so strong [s:]

In a lie, I'm tired
Induced euphoria to help me move along (Induced euphoria, help me move along)

I wanna meet my maker in peace
I want to feel alive again
So put that smile back on my face
And mix it strong my friend

[g: Pre-chorus]

[q: C1]
[p: C2] And I take my life tonight
'Cause I have the right to die how I wanna
And leave how I arrived /
So alive [s:]

I believe my sins have been forgiven
And I believe my choice will save me from this life
Please don't question why

My sins have been forgotten
I believe I'll find peace in afterlife
Please don't question why /
I left this way

[g: Pre-chorus]

[q: C1]
[q: C2]
Alive!
