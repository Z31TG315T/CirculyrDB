[v: 0.4 | 1]

Let's take a moment and break the ice
So my intentions are known
See, I have pity in watching you suffer
I know the feeling of being damned alone
I've got a storybook of my own
Don't you see...

[p: C1] I am your pride, agent of wealth, bearer of needs (And you know it's right)
I am your war, arming the strong, aiding the weak [s:]
[p: C2] Know me by name, Shepherd of Fire [s:]

Well, I can promise you paradise
No need to serve on your knees
And when you're lost in the darkest of hours
Take a moment and tell me who you see
Won't tell you who not to be
Now you know...

[q: C1]
[q: C2]

Disciple of the cross and champion in suffering
Immerse yourself into the kingdom of redemption
Pardon your mind through the chains of the divine
Make way, the Shepherd of Fire

Through the ages of time
I've been known for my hate
But I'm a dealer of simple choices
For me it's never too late

[q: C1]
I am your wrath, I am your guilt, I am your lust (And you know it's right)
I am your law, I am your stall, I am your trust
[q: C2]
