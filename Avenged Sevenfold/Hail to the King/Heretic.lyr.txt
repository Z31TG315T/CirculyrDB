[v: 0.4 | 1]

As they search for blood
All eyes descend on one
Honest man in chains
But that don't matter anyway
My judgement day

My flesh will feed the demon
[p: C1] No trial, no case for reason
I've been chosen to pay with my life
Mad men define what matters
Turning witches and saints to ashes [s:]
Rising masses marching to find heretic blood

Impose your will on me
'Til fire sets me free
The flames of hell burn bright
My fate decided by their lies
Final demise

My flesh will feed the demon
[q: C1]
[p: C2] Rising masses marching to find heretic
Heretic blood [s:]

Please don't leave me
Please don't leave me like this
I've walked a fragile life and I've fallen down
Please don't leave me

My flesh will feed the demon, now
[q: C1]
