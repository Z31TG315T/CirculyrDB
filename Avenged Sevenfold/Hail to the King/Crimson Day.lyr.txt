[v: 0.4 | 1]

Dark years brought endless rain
Out in the cold, I lost my way
But storms won't last, they clear the air for something new
The sun came out and brought you through

[r: Pre-chorus]
A lifetime full of words to say
A hope that time will slow the passing day
[s:]

[r: Chorus]
I've been wrong, time's over
And I've been shamed with no words to find
But if the sun will rise, bring us tomorrow
Walk with me
Crimson day
[s:]

Don't speak, no useful words
Lie in my arms, sleep secure
I wonder what you're dreaming of, lands rare and far
A timeless flight to reach the stars

[g: Pre-chorus]

[g: Chorus]

I've come so far to meet you here
To share this life with one I hold so dear
And I will speak but what is true
The world outside created just for you
It's for you
For you

[g: Chorus]
