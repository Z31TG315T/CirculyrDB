[v: 0.4 | 1]

[r: Bridge]
Prodigia comploratus
Silens oro regnet exitium
[s:]

Days of warning
Night brings morning
My prayers worthless
Heaven is burning down

I walk, stricken
Pitch black vision
O One, save me
Caress my weary eyes

[r: Chorus]
Darkest Lord, your mercy shall I gain
Strike the match, engulf the earth in flames
In flames [x3]
[s:]

Nature quaking
Prophets aching
I kneel, faithful
Damnation cracks the sky

My heart, fiction
Superstition
Your grace, deathless
Give life to my last breath

[g: Chorus]

Grant them eternal rest, O Lord
Embrace them into your army of undead
Strike with vengeance those who oppose your will
And lay waste to all opposition set before you
Walk with them and shield them from the blinding light of servitude
And devastate your enemies as they die by your hand
Amen

[g: Bridge]

Rise from ashes
Violence clashes
My soul, vacant
Cleanse me of all this sin

I stand guilty
I bleed filthy
Born of fire
Savor this final hour

[g: Chorus]
