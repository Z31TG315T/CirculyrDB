The lives of some men
If walls could talk to spill the lies
We'd see the world through devil's eyes

I maintain an addiction
Been known to take it too high
I got an itch with a loaded hair trigger, and a /
One-way ticket to fly

When there's no writing on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
I don't need no lessons after all
Everybody's doing their time

Caught your eye in the corner
Don't you look at me wrong
Fucked up and thrown into the gutter, gotta /
Fix what don't belong

I see your writing on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
I don't need no lessons after all
Everybody's doing their time

That's just the price to play
So tell me what you're like
Gotta hand on a kerosene match tonight

Had enough of opinions
I got enough on my mind
Sell your soul for approval and a dollar, got a /
Pretty little body to grind

I see your number on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
I don't need no lessons, watch the fall
You lost my attention after all
Everybody's doing their time
Time!
