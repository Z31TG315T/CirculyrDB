[v: 0.4 | 1]

Godless meteoric war
Anger, our existence nevermore

You awoke the giants who were dormant in the sky
Comets raining death from a fiery eye

[r: Chorus]
Mother of all
Your time is coming
One with eternity

When planets collide
Planets collide
[s:]

Damage, galaxy destruct
Endless celestial orbit corrupt

[r: Pre-chorus 2]
You will be forgotten like the others, lost in time
Dead civilization left behind
[s:]

[g: Chorus]

Take heed, the burning march is closing in
You can't defeat them on your own
Weapons are loaded for the final stand
A they're all aimed at you from heaven

Planets collide [x4]

[g: Pre-chorus 2]
