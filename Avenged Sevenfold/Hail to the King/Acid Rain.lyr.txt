[v: 0.4 | 1]

Our day has come
It's drawn in the sky
So don't shed a tear, now
Be thankful for the time

Life wouldn't be so precious, dear, if there never was an end

[p: C1] Children still play in the garden
Dance as the sun slips away [s:]

We stand on the edge now
We've come so far
Through all the dust it becomes clear
You will always be my heart

There's no death, no end of time when I'm facing it with you

[q: C1]
[p: C2] Not even stars last forever
Cleanse us, acid rain [s:]

Stand near to me
Don't look, be brave
Over the blackened moon, I'll carry you away
Through the planets we fly

[q: C1]
[q: C2]

Send us home [x4]
