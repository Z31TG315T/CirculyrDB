[v: 0.4 | 1]

I've been away searching for a reason
Another purpose to find
I've sailed the seas, fought my many demons
I've looked to gods in the skies

I've stood in hell, where many had to suffer
I stared the devil in the eyes
Walked many roads to witness ancient idols
And found the great gates of fire

Had many storms question my conviction
Gave armies reason to rise
The hangman searching for bones he can borrow /
While I escaped in the night
Fight or flight

[r: Chorus]
Live again, all roads end
I'll be coming home
Tend your light 'cause on this night
I'll be coming home
[s:]

Escaped the hail of calculated mortars
Then drank the blood of a king
The desert rain has washed away direction
An angel's looking after me /
So it seems

[g: Chorus]

My story ends not far from where it started
My weary limbs have grown old
I've seen the world through the eyes of a nomad
Home is where the heart is I've been told
So I go

[g: Chorus]

I'm coming home [x4]
