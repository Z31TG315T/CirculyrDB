[v: 0.4 | 1]

Hide my face again, harbor in the shadows
Feel this weight of sin hammering away
Die with the guilt of a thousand AWOL soldiers
Die, watch the scythe usher me astray

I can't go on this way, not as I am today
The ugly side of me is strong
Take aim, a loaded gun, pull back on all who run
A coward's truth inside the wrong

This means war [x3]

Lash your tongue of bane, carry me to nowhere
Mental holocaust, battle never ends
Lie, mask the pain of a child who's forsaken
Lie to myself, praise the new regime

I left me long ago, reasons you'll never know
No one to miss me when I'm gone
With no more words to say, no argument to stay
Another post I don't belong

This means war [x5]

No home to call my own, no finding someone new
No-one to break the fall, no-one to see me through
No name to carry on, no promise for today
No-one to hear the call, no tattered flag to raise

Walk the razor's edge, cut into the madness
Question all you trust, buy into the fear
I see the man ripping at my soul now
I- I know the man, I know him all too well

There's nothing here for free, lost who I want to be
My serpent blood can strike so cold
On any given day I'll take it all away
Another thought I can't control

This means war [x5]
