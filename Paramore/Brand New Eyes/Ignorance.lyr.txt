[v: 0.4 | 1]

If I'm a bad person, you don't like me
Well, I guess I'll make my own way
It's a circle - I mean cycle
I can't excite you anymore

Where's your gable? Your jury?
What's my offence this time?
You're not a judge, but if you're gonna judge me /
Well, sentence me to another life

[r: Pre-chorus 1]
Don't wanna hear your sad songs, I don't wanna feel your pain
When you swear it's all my fault 'cause you know we're not the same
We're not the same
Oh, we're not the same
[s:]

Yeah, the friends who stuck together, we wrote our names in blood
But I guess you can't accept that the change is good
It's good [x2]

[r: Chorus]
Well, you treat me just like another stranger
Well, it's nice to meet you sir, I guess I'll go /
I best be on my way out

You treat me just like another stranger
Well, it's nice to meet you sir, I guess I'll go /
I best be on my way out
[s:]

Ignorance is your new best friend [x2]

And this is the best thing that could have happened
Any longer and I wouldn't have made it
It's not war, no, it's not a rapture
I'm just a person, but you can't take it

The same tricks that- that once fooled me
They won't get you anywhere
I'm not the same kid from your memory
Well, now I can fend for myself

[g: Pre-chorus 1]

Yeah, we used to stick together, we wrote our names in blood
But I guess you can't accept that the change is good
It's good [x2]

[g: Chorus]

Ignorance is your new best friend [x4]

[g: Chorus]
