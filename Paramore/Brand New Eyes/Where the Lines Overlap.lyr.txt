[v: 0.4 | 1]

Give me attention, I need it now
Too much distance to measure it out out loud
Tracing patterns across a personal map
And making pictures where the lines overlap
Where the lines overlap

[r: Chorus]
No-one is as lucky as us
We're not at the end but, well, we already won
Oh, no, no-one
Is as lucky as us [x2]
[s:]

Call me over and tell me how /
Well, you got so far, and never making a single sound
I'm not used to it but I can learn
There's nothing to it, I've never been happier
Never been happier

[g: Chorus]

Now I've got a feeling if I sang this loud enough
You would sing it back to me
I've got a feeling if I sang this loud enough
You would sing it back to me
I've got a feeling (I've got a feeling)
That you would sing it back to me
You would sing it back to me

[g: Chorus]
Is as lucky as us
