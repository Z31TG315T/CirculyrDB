Things are looking up, oh, finally
I thought I'd never see the day when you'd smile at me
We always pull through, oh, when we try
I'm always wrong, but you're never right
Oh, you're never right

[p: C1] Honestly, can you believe we crossed the world while it's asleep?
I'd never trade it in 'cause I've always wanted this, and / [s:]
It's not a dream anymore, no
It's not a dream anymore, it's worth fighting for

Could have given up so easily
I was a few cheap shots away from the end of me
Taking for granted, most everything
That I would have died for just yesterday
Just yesterday

[q: C1]
It's not a dream anymore, no
It's not a dream anymore, it's worth fighting for

God knows the world doesn't need another band
Whoa, whoa
But what a waste it would've been
Whoa, whoa
[p: B1] I can't believe we almost hung it up
Whoa, whoa
We're just getting started [s:]
Whoa, whoa

[q: C1]
It's not a dream anymore, no [x3]
It's not a dream anymore, it's worth fighting for

[q: B1]
Whoa, whoa
[q: B1]
Yeah, we're just getting started
