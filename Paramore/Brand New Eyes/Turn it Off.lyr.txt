[v: 0.4 | 1]

I scrapped my knees while I was praying
And found a demon in my safest heaven, seems like /
It's getting harder to believe in anything than /
Just to get lost in all my selfish thoughts

[p: V1] I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride, to see nothing in the light
But turn it off in all my spite
In all my spite, I'll turn it off [s:]

[r: Chorus]
And the worst part is, before it gets /
Any better we're headed for a cliff
Then in the freefall I will realize /
I'm better off when I hit the bottom
[s:]

The tragedy it seems unending
I'm watching everyone I looked up to break and bending
We're taking shortcuts and false illusions
Just to come out the hero

Well, I can see behind the curtain
The wheels are cranking, turning, it's all wrong, the way we're working /
Towards a goal that's nonexistent /
It's nonexistent But we just keep believing

[g: Chorus]

[q: V1]
Just turn it off

Again
Again, again

[g: Chorus]
[x2]
