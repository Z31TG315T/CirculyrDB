We still live in the same town, well, don't we?
But I don't see you around anymore
I go to all the same places, not even a trace of you
Your days are numbered at twenty-four

And I'm getting bored waiting 'round for you
We're not getting any younger, and /
I won't look back, 'cause there's no use
It's time to move forward

[p: C1] I feel no sympathy
You live inside a cave
You barely get by, the rest of us are trying [s:]
There's no need to apologize, I've got no time for feeling sorry

Well, I try not to think of what might happen
When your reality, it finally cuts through
Well, as for me, I got out and I'm on the road
The worst part is that this- this could be you

You know it, too - you can't run from your shame
You're not getting any younger, and /
Time keeps passing by, but you wave it away
It's time to roll over

[q: C1]
There's no need to apologize, I've got no time for feeling sorry

And all the best lies
They are told with fingers tied, so /
Cross 'em tight
Won't you promise me tonight
If it's the last thing you do you'll get out

[q: C1]
There's no need to apologize, I've got no time, I've got no time

[q: C1]
There's no need to apologize, I've got no time

I've got no time for feeling sorry [x2]
