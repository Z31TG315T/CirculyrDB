[v: 0.4 | 1]

Think of me when you're out- when you're out there
I'll beg you nice from my knees
And when the world treats you way too fairly
Well, it's a shame I'm a dream

All I wanted was you [x2]

I think I'll pace my apartment a few times
And fall asleep on the couch
And wake up early to black-and-white reruns /
That escape from my mouth

All I wanted was you [x4]

I could follow you to the beginning
Just to relive the start
And maybe then, we'd remember to slow down /
At all of our favorite parts

All I wanted was you [x5]
