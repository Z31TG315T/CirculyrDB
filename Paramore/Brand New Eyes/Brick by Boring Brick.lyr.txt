Well, she lives in a fairy tale
Somewhere too far for us to find
Forgotten the taste and smell
Of a world that she's left behind

It's all about the exposure /
The lens, I told her
The angles were all wrong, now she's /
Ripping wings off of butterflies

Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds

[p: C1] Well, go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle [s:]
[p: C2] Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle [s:]

So one day he found her crying /
Coiled up on the dirty ground
Her prince finally came to save her
And the rest she can figure out

But it was a trick and the /
Clock struck twelve, well, make sure
To build your home brick by boring brick
Or the wolf's gonna blow it down

Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds

[q: C1]
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
And we'll bury the castle, bury the castle

Well, you built up a world of magic
Because your real life is tragic
Yeah, you built up a world of magic

If it's not real, you can't hold it in your hand
You can't feel it with your heart
And I won't believe it

But if it's true, you can see it with your eyes
Oh, even in the dark
And that's where I want to be, yeah
