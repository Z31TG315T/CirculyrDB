[c: C2 is C1 w/o "you"]

I settled down; a twisted-up frown /
Disguised as a smile, well /
You would have never known

I had it all, but not what I wanted
'Cause over me was a place uncharted /
And overgrown

You'd make your way in
I'd resist you just like this
You can't tell me to feel
The truth never set me free so I did it myself

[p: C1] You can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer [s:]
You've got to reach a little /
More [x5]

Open your eyes like I opened mine
It's only the real world
A life you will never know

Shifting your weight to throw off the pain
Well, you can ignore it
But only for so long

You look like I did
You resist me just like this
You can't tell me to heal
And it hurts remembering how it felt to shut down

[p: C2] Can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer [s:]
You've got to reach a little /
More [x5]

The truth never set me free [x3]
So I'll do it myself

[q: C1]
You've got to reach out

[q: C2]
You've got to reach out
More [x5]
