[f: count-in]

I'm going away for a while, but I'll be back, don't try and follow me
'Cause I'll return as soon as possible
See, I'm trying to find my place, but it might not be here where I feel safe
We all learn to make mistakes

And run from them- from them
With no direction
Oh, run from them- from them
With no conviction

'Cause I'm just one of those ghosts
Travelling endlessly
Don't need no roads
In fact, they follow me
And we just go in circles

And now I'm told that this is life, that pain is just a simple compromise
So we can get what we want out of it
Would someone care to classify our broken hearts and twisted minds?
So I can find someone to rely on

And run to them- to them
Full speed ahead
Oh, you are not useless
We are just...

Misguided ghosts
Travelling endlessly
The ones we trusted the most
Pushed us far away

And there's no one road
We should not be the same
But I'm just a ghost
And still they echo me
They echo me in circles
