You say the sweetest things, and I can't keep my heart from singing /
Along to the sound of your song; my stupid feet keep moving
For this four-four beat, I'm in time with you, whoa
To this four-four beat, I would die for you (Die for you)
Someone stop this

[p: PC1] I've gone too far to come back from here
But you don't have a clue
You don't know what you do to me [s:]

[p: C1] Won't someone stop this song?
So I won't sing along
Someone stop this song
So I won't sing [s:]

I never let love in so I could keep my heart from hurting
The longer that I live with this idea, the more I sink in
For this four-four beat, I'm in time with you, whoa
To this four-four beat, I would die for you (Let's stop this song)

[q: PC1]
And I've gone too far to get over you
And you don't have a clue
You don't know what you do to me

[q: C1]
Your lovesick melody
Is gonna get the best of me tonight
But you won't get to me
If I don't sing

It creeps in like a spider /
That can't be killed, although I try and try to
Well, don't you see I'm falling?
Don't wanna love you, but I do

(Lovesick melody) Won't someone stop this song?
So I won't sing along
(Lovesick melody) Someone stop this song
So I won't sing

Your lovesick melody
Is gonna get the best of me tonight
But you won't get to me, no, you won't get to me
'Cause I won't sing
