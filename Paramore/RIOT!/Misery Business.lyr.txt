I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine she caught him by the mouth

I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we had caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

[p: C1] Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now [s:]
[p: C2] Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now [s:]

[p: C3] But, god, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now [s:]
[p: C4] And if you could then you know you would
'Cause, god, it just feels so
It just feels so good [s:]

Second chances? They don't ever matter; people never change
Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way

Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who /
They want and what they like it's easy if you do it right
Well, I refuse, I refuse, I refuse

But, god, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him right now

I watched his wildest dreams come true
Not one of them involving you
Just watch my wildest dreams come true
Not one of them involving
