Oh no, I just keep on falling (Back to the same old)
And where's hope when misery comes crawling? (Oh, my way)
With your faith, you'll trigger a landslide (Victory)
To kill off this common sense of mind

It takes acquired minds /
To taste it, taste it, taste this wine
You can't down it with your eyes
So we don't need the headlines
We don't need the headlines, we just want
(We want our airwaves back) [x2]

[p: C1] Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
(Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now?)
Everybody live like it's the last day you will ever see
(Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now?) [s:]

Right now, you're the only reason (I'm not letting go)
And I'm out if everyone's worth pleasing
(Whoa) You'll trigger a landslide (Victory)
To kill off their finite state of mind

It takes acquired minds /
To taste it, taste it, taste this wine
You can't down it with your eyes
So we don't need the headlines
No, we don't want your headlines, we just want
(We want our airwaves back) [x2]

[q: C1]
Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
(Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure?)

Alright, so you think you're ready?
Okay, then you'll say this with me, go:
We were born for this (We were born for this)
[x2]
We were born for this (We were born for this)
We were born for, we were born for

Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
(Tell me, tell me, can you feel the pressure?)
Everybody live like it's the last day you will ever see
(Tell me, tell me, can you feel the pressure now?)
Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
(Tell me, tell me, can you feel the pressure?) [x2]

We were born for this (We were born for this)
We were born for this
