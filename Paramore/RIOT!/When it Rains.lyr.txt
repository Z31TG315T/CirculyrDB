And when it rains /
On this side of town it touches /
Everything
Just say it again and mean it

We don't miss a thing
You made yourself a bed at the bottom of the blackest hole
And convinced yourself that it's not the reason you don't see the sun anymore

[p: C1] And oh, how could you do it?
Oh, I- I never saw it coming [s:]
[p: C2] Oh, I need an ending, so /
Why can't you stay just long enough to explain? [s:]

And when it rains
Well, you always find an escape
Just running away
From all of the ones who love you

From everything
You made yourself a bed at the bottom of the blackest hole
And you'll sleep 'til May, and you'll say that you don't wanna see the sun anymore

(Take your time)
(Take my time)

Take these chances to turn it around (Take your time)
Just take these chances, we'll make it somehow
And take these chances to turn it around (Take my time)
Just turn it around

[q: C1]
[q: C1]
[q: C1]
[q: C2]
You can take your time
Take my time
