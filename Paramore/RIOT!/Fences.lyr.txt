I'm sitting in a room
Made up of only big white walls, and in the hall there are /
People looking through /
The window in the door, tthey know exactly what we're here for
Don't look up, just let them think there's /
No place else you'd rather be, you're...

Always on display
For everyone to watch and learn from, don't you know by now
You can't turn back
Because this road is all you'll ever have

[p: C1] And it's obvious that you're dying, dying
Just living proof that the camera's lying
And o- o- open wide [s:]
'Cause this is your night, so smile
'Cause you'll go out in style
You'll go out in style

If you'd let me I could
I'd show you how to build your fences, set restrictions /
Separate from the world
The constant battle that you hate to fight, just blame the limelight
Don't look up, just let them think there's /
No place else you'd rather be, and...

Now you can't turn back
Because this road is all you'll ever have

[q: C1]
'Cause this is your night, so smile

Yeah, yeah, you're asking for it
With every breath that you breathe in
Just breathe it in

Yeah, yeah, well, you're just a mess
You do all this big talking
So now let's see you walk it
I said, let's see you walk it
[x2]

[q: C1]
Yeah, o- o- open wide [x2]
'Cause you'll go out in style
You'll go out in style
