I've gone for too long /
Living like I'm not alive
So I'm gonna start over tonight
Beginning with you and I

When this memory fades /
I'm gonna make sure it's replaced /
With chances taken, hope embraced
And have I told you?

[p: C1] I'm not going
'Cause I've been waiting for a miracle
And I'm not leaving
I won't let you
Let you give up on a miracle [s:]
When it might save you

We've learned to run from /
Anything uncomfortable
We've tied our pain below
And no-one ever has to know that...

Inside, we're broken
I try to patch things up again
To count my tears and kill these fears
But have I told you? Have I?

[q: C1]
When it might save you

It's not faith if
If you use your eyes
Oh, I /
Will get it right this time (this time)
Let's leave this all behind, oh I /
Will get it right this time
It's not faith if you're using your eyes
Oh, I...

Now, I've gone for too long /
Living like I'm not alive
So I'm going to start over tonight
Beginning with you and...

I don't want to run from /
Anything uncomfortable
I just want, no
I just need this pain to end right here

[q: C1]
'Cause it might save you
Yeah, it might save you
Oh, it might save you
It's not faith if
If you use your eyes [x3]
