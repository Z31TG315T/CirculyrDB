[v: 0.4 | 1]

Somehow, everything's gonna fall right into place
If we only had a way to make it all fall faster everyday
If only time flew like a dove
Will God make it fly faster than I'm falling in love?

[p: C1] This time we're not giving up
Let's make it last forever, screaming /
Hallelujah [s:]
We'll make it last forever

Holding onto patience wearing thin
I can't force these eyes to see the end
If only time flew like a dove
Well, we could watch it fly and just keep looking up

[q: C1]
We'll make it last forever

And we've got time on our hands (We've got time)
Got nothing but time on our hands
Got nothing but, got nothing but (Got nothing but time)
Got nothing but time on our hands

[q: C1]
Hallelujah
