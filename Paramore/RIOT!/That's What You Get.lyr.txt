[v: 0.4 | 1]

No, sir, well, I don't wanna be the blame, not anymore
It's your turn, so take a seat, we're settling the final score

And why do we like to hurt so much?

I can't decide, you have made it harder just to go on
And why? All the possibilities, well, I was wrong

[r: Chorus 1]
That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa [x2]
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
[s:]

I wonder - how am I supposed to feel when you're not here?
'Cause I burned every bridge I ever built when you were here
I still try holding onto silly things, I never learned
Oh, why? All the possibilities, I'm sure you've heard

[g: Chorus 1]

Pain, make your way to me, to me
And I'll always be just so inviting
If I ever start to think straight
This heart will start a riot in me
Let's start, start, hey

Why do we like to hurt so much?
Oh, why do we like to hurt so much?

That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa

That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa [x2]
Now I can't trust myself with anything but this
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
