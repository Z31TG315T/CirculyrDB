I got a lot to say to you
Yeah, I got a lot to say
I've noticed your eyes are always glued to me
Keeping them here, and it makes no sense at all

They taped over your mouth, scribbled out the /
Truth with their lies, you little spies
[x2]

Crush [x5]
(Two, three, four)

[p: C1] Nothing compares to
A quiet evening alone
Just the one, two
I was just counting on [s:]

[p: C2] That never happens
I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than / [s:]
This

If you wanna play it like a game
Well, come on, come on, let's play
'Cause I'd rather waste my life pretending /
Than have to forget you for one whole minute

They taped over your mouth, scribbled out the /
Truth with their lies, you little spies
[x2]

Crush [x5]
(Two, three, four)

[q: C1]
[q: C2]
This now

Rock and roll, baby
Don't you know that /
We're all alone now?
I need something to sing about

[p: B1] Rock and roll, hey
Don't you know, baby /
We're all alone now [s:]
I need something to sing about

[q: B1]
Give me something to sing about

Nothing compares to
A quiet evening alone
Just the one, two

[p: C1]
[p: C2]
No
[p: C1]
[p: C2]
More than this, whoa
