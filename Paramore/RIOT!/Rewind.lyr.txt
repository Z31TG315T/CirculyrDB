Don't come looking for me
'Cause I'll be right here with the words you said
I'm looking for the words to say
You know what you did, you know

And how can anybody /
Forget the promise that you made?
'Cause, this is how this promise breaks
I always knew you'd fall through, and /
Now you're proof

And rewind to the first time that I felt it coming
I knew it would not last
[p: C1] And rewind to the first time that I felt it coming
Make it quick, make it painless (Painless)
And don't tell me a lie, just say goodbye [s:]

And now you're running from me
So cool, so scared of what you might have said
But no-one's ever looked away
'Cause we know what you did, we know

If I told anybody
That we would soon forget your name
And you would never have a place
I always knew you'd fall through, and /
Now you're proof

And rewind to the first time that I felt it coming
And I knew it would not last
[q: C1]

Please don't say too much, oh, I /
Think we've heard enough from you, oh

And rewind to the first time that I felt it coming
And I knew it would not last
[q: C1]
Don't tell me a lie, just say goodbye
