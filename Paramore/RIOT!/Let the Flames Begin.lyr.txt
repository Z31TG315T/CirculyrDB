[v: 0.4 | 1]

Oh, what a shame we all became /
Such fragile, broken things
A memory remains
Just a tiny spark

I give it all my oxygen
So let the flames begin
So let the flames begin, O glory
O glory

[p: C1] This is how we'll dance when /
When they try to take us down [s:]
This is what will be our glory

Somewhere weakness is our strength
And I'll die searching for it
I can't let myself regret /
Such selfishness

My pain and all the trouble caused
No matter how long
I believe that there's hope /
Buried beneath it all, and /
Hiding beneath it all, and /
Growing beneath it all, and...

[q: C1]
[p: C2] This is how we'll sing out
This is how we'll stand when /
When they burn our houses down
This is what will be our glory [s:]

Reaching as I sink down into light [x2]

[q: C1]
