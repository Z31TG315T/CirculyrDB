[v: 0.4 | 1]

Just talk yourself up and tear yourself down
You've hit your one wall, now find a way around
Well, what's the problem? You've got a lot of nerve

[r: Pre-chorus]
So what did you think I would say?
No, you can't run away [x2]
[x2]
You wouldn't
[s:]

[r: Chorus]
I never wanted to say this
You never wanted to stay
I put my faith in you, so much faith, and then you /
Just threw it away
[s:]

You threw it away

I'm not so naive, my sorry eyes can see
The way you fight shy of almost everything
Well, if you give up, you'll get what you deserve

[g: Pre-chorus]

[g: Chorus]

You threw it away

You were finished long before
We had even seen the start
Why don't you stand up, be a man about it
Fight with your bare hands about it now

[g: Chorus]
[x2]
