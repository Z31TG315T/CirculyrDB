[v: 0.4 | 1]

I am outside and I've been waiting for the sun /
With my wide eyes, I've seen worlds that don't belong
My mouth is dry with words I cannot verbalize
Tell me why we live like this

Keep me safe inside, your arms like towers
Tower over me, yeah

[r: Chorus]
'Cause we are broken, what must we do to restore /
Our innocence and all the promise we adored?
Give us life again 'cause we just wanna be whole
[s:]

Lock the doors, 'cause I'd like to capture this voice
It came to me tonight, so everyone will have a choice
And under red lights I'll show myself it wasn't forged
We're at war, we live like this

Keep me safe inside, your arms like towers
Tower over me

[g: Chorus]

Tower over me [x2]

And I'll take the truth at any cost

[g: Chorus]
