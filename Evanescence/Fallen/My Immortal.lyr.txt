[v: 0.4 | 1]

I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave, I wish that you would just leave
Your presence still lingers here, and it won't leave me alone

[r: Pre-chorus]
These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just to real
There's just too much that time cannot erase
[s:]

[r: Chorus]
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have
All of me
[s:]

You used to captivate me by your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face, it haunts my once-pleasant dreams
Your voice, it chased away all the sanity in me

[g: Pre-chorus]

[g: Chorus]

I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me, I've been alone all along

[g: Chorus]

All of me [x2]
