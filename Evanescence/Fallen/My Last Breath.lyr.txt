[v: 0.4 | 1]

Hold on to me, love
You know I can't stay long
All I wanted to say was I love you and I'm not afraid, oh
Can you hear me?
Can you feel me in your arms?

[r: Chorus]
Holding my last breath
Safe inside myself /
Are all my thoughts of you
Sweet raptured life, it ends here tonight
[s:]

I miss the winter
A world of fragile things
Look for me in the white forest, hiding in a hollow tree (Come find me)
I know you hear me
I can taste it in your tears

[g: Chorus]

Closing your eyes to disappear
You pray your dreams will leave you here
But still you wake and know the truth
No-one's there

Say goodnight
Don't be afraid
Calling me, calling me as you /
Fade to black

(Say goodnight) Holding my last breath
(Don't be afraid) Safe inside myself /
(Calling me, calling me) Are all my thoughts of you
Sweet raptured life, it ends here tonight

(Holding my last breath)
(Safe inside myself /)
(Are all my thoughts of you)
(Sweet raptured life, it ends here tonight)
