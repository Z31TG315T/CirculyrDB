[v: 0.4 | 1]

You don't remember me, but I remember you
I lie awake and try so hard not think of you
But who can decide what they dream? And dream I do

[r: Chorus]
I believe in you
I'll give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you
To live, to breathe
You're taking over me
[s:]

Have you forgotton all I know, and all we had?
You saw me mourning my love for you, and touched my hand
I knew you loved me then

[g: Chorus]

I look in mirror and see your face
If I look deep enough
So many things inside that, just like you, are taking over

[g: Chorus]
[x2]

(Taking over me) You're taking over me
(Taking over me) Taking over me
