Perfect by nature
Icons of self-indulgence
Just what we all need
More lies about our world that...

Never was and never will be
Have you no shame? Don't you see me
You know you've got everybody fooled

Look, here she comes now
Bow down and stare in wonder
Oh, how we loved you
Know the laws when you're pretending
But now I know she...

Never was and never will be
You don't know how you betrayed me
And somehow you've got everybody fooled

Without the mask
Where will you hide
Can't find yourself
Lost in your light

I know the truth now
I know who you are
And I don't love you anymore

It never was and never will be
You don't know how you etrayed me
And somehow you've got everybody fooled
It never was and never will be
You're not real and you can't save me
And somehow now you're everybody's fool
