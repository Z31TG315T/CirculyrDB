Playground, schoolbell rings again
Rainclouds come to play again

Has no-one told you she's not breathing
Hello, I'm your mind
Giving you someone to talk to
Hello?

If I smile and don't believe
Soon I know I'll wake from this dream

Don't try to fix me, I'm not broken
Hello, I'm the lie
Living for you so you can hide
Don't cry

Suddenly I know I'm not sleeping
Hello, I- I'm still here
All that's left of yesterday
