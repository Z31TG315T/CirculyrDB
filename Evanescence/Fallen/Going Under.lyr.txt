Now I will tell you what I've done for you
Fifty thousand tears I've cried
Screaming, decieving and bleeding for you
And you still won't hear me (Going under)

Don't want your hand this time, I'll save myself
Maybe I'll wake up for once (I'll wake up for once)
Not tormented daily, defeated by you
Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom

I'm diving in

I'm going under (Going under)
Drowning in you (Drowning in you)
I'm falling forever (Falling forever)
I've got to break through, I'm /
Going under

Luring and stirring the truth and the lies (So tell me what's real)
So tell me what's real and what's not (Tell me what's real and what's not)
Always confusing the thoughts in my head
So I can't trust myself anymore

I'm diving in

I'm going under (Going under)
Drowning in you (Drowning in you)
I'm falling forever (Falling forever)
I've got to break through, oh

So go on and scream - scream at me
I'm so far away
I won't be broken again
I've got to breathe, I can't keep going under

I'm diving in

I'm going under (Going under)
Drowning in you (Drowning in you)
I'm falling forever (Falling forever)
I've got to break through, I'm /
Going under (Going under)
Going under (Drowning in you)
I'm going under
