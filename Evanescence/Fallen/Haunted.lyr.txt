[v: 0.4 | 1]

Long lost words whispered slowly to me
Still can't find what keeps me here
When all this time I've been so hollow inside
Are you still there?

[p: C1] Watching me, wanting me
I can feel you hold me down [s:]
Fearing you, loathing you
I won't let you hold me down

Haunting you, I can smell you - alive
Your heart pounding in my head

[q: C1]
Saving me, raping me
Watching me

(Watching me, wanting me)
(I can) Feel you hold me down
(Fearing you, loathing you)
I won't let you pull me down
