[v: 0.4 | 1]

I linger in the doorway /
Of alarm clocks screaming, monsters calling my name
Let me stay where the wind will whisper to me
Where the raindrops, as they're falling, tell a story

[r: Chorus]
In my field of paper flowers
In candy clouds of lullaby (flowers)
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me (flowers)
[s:]

Don't say I'm out of touch /
With this rampant chaos, your reality
I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge
The nightmare I built my own world to escape

[g: Chorus]

Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming
Cannot cease for the fear of silent lies
Oh, how I long for the deep sleep dreaming
The godess of imaginary light

[g: Chorus]

(Paper flowers) [x2]
