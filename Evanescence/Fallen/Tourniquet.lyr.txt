[v: 0.4 | 1]

I tried to kill the pain, but only brought more (So much more)
I lay dying, and I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal

[r: Pre-chorus]
I'm dying, praying (Dying, praying)
Bleeding and screaming (Bleeding, screaming)
Am I too lost to be saved?
Am I too lost?
[s:]

[r: Chorus]
My god, my tourniquet
Return to me, salvation
My god, my tourniquet
Return to me, salvation
[s:]

Do you remember me, lost for so long?
Will you be on the other side, or will you forget me?

[g: Pre-chorus]

[g: Chorus]

(Return to me salvation)
(I want to die!)

[g: Chorus]

My wounds cry for the grave
My soul cries for deliverance
Will I be denied /
Christ, tourniquet, my suicide?

(Return to me salvation) [x2]
