It's too late to change your mind
Even though this fragile world /
Is tearing apart at the seams
I can't wash these sins away
This sinking feeling everyday
I'm waking up in someone else's life

[p: C1] Is it so hard for you?
'Cause it's so hard for me
To believe that what we dreamed could ever come to life again [s:]
'Cause I cannot erase this life

Not gonna let this day go by
I'm gonna save this wasted life
And nothing can stand in my way
Not enough to say goodbye
Burn it 'til there's nothing left
I'm drowning in the mess that I have made

[q: C1]
'Cause I cannot erase this darkness in me

The water's rising around us
There is no other way down
I only have myself to blame /
For it all

[q: C1]
If I could just erase my mind
But I cannot erase this life
