Do what you, what you want /
If you have a dream for better (It isn't over)
Do what you, what you want /
'Til you don't want it anymore (Remember who you really are)

Do what you, what you want /
Your world's closing in on you now (It isn't over)
Stand and face the unknown (Got to remember who you really are)

Every heart in my hands like a pale reflection

[p: C1] Hello, hello, remember me?
I'm everything you can't control
Somewhere beyond the pain [s:]
There must be a way to believe we can break through

Do what you, what you want /
You don't have to lay your life down (It isn't over)
Do what you, what you want /
'Til you find what you're looking for (Got to remember who you really are)

But every hour slipping by screams that I have failed you

[q: C1]
There must be a way to believe
[x2]

There's still time, close your eyes
Only love will guide you home
Tear down the walls and free your soul

'Til we crash, we're forever spiraling
Down, down, down, down

Hello, hello, it's only me
Infecting everything you love
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe

[q: C1]
There must be a way to learn forgiveness

[q: C1]
There must be a way to believe we can break through (Remember who you really are)

Do what you, what you want
