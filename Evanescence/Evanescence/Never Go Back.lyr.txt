[v: 0.4 | 1]

Everything is so dark
And I know there's something wrong, but I /
Can't turn the light on

In that split second change /
When you knew we couldn't hold on, I realized
I live to love you

[r: Pre-chorus 1] Save yourself, don't look back
Tearing us apart until it's... [s:]

[p: C1] All gone
The only world I've ever known
Sleeps beneath the waves [s:]
But I remember

I won't give up on you
I can feel you in my heart, just show me the way
I don't belong here, alone

I can still see your face /
Where it's burned into my mind, I die every time
I close my eyes, you're always there

[g: Pre-chorus 1]

[q: C1]
[p: C2] But I'm the one who's drowning
Without your love, I am lost /
And I can never go back [s:]
Home

All across the ocean
We are calling, calling
Are you there?
Nothing left for me 'til I find you, because it's...

[q: C1]
[q: C2]
I- I can never go back home
