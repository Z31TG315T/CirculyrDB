[v: 0.4 | 1]

Make me whole again, open your eyes
Taunted by the shadows of your lie
Cold and far away, but not even mine
Undo everything and take me higher
Never believing what they say, 'cause I'm...

[p: C1] Counting the days to meet you on the other side
I will always be waiting
Until the day that I see you on the other side [s:]
Come and take me home

I'm not giving in, I want you back
Holding together by the shards of our past
Stole my heart away, I can't let you go
Break these chains and let me fly to you, high /
Above the world below
Over and over in my mind

[q: C1]
Come and take me home

I am so lost without my place inside your heart
I won't survive, I need to know you hear me

Awaken and released, my love

[q: C1]
Come and take me
[q: C1]
Come and take me home
