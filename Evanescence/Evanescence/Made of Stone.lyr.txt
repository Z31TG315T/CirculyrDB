Speak your mind
Like I care
I can see your lips moving
I've just learned not to hear

Don't waste your time

[p: C1] It's never enough for you, baby
Don't want to play your game anymore
No matter what you say
I'm all out of love for you, baby
And now that I've tried everything [s:]
I'll numb the pain 'til I am made of stone

Take your time
I'm not scared
Make me everything you need me to be
So the judgment seems fair

Don't waste your time

[q: C1]
I'll numb the pain 'til I am made...

To tear out my heart
For the way that it feels
I will still remember when you've long forgotten me

[q: C1]
I'll numb the pain 'til I am made of stone
It's never enough (I'm not gonna play /)
It's never enough (Your game)
It's never enough
I'll numb the pain 'til I am made of stone [x2]
