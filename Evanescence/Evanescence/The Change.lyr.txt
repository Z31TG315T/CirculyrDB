Thought that I was strong
I know the words I need to say
Frozen in my place
I let the moment slip away

[p: C1] I've been screaming on the inside and I know you feel the pain
Can you hear me? Can you hear me? [s:]
[p: C2] Say it's over, yes, it's over but I need you anyway
Say you love me but it's not enough [s:]

Never meant to lie
But I'm not the girl you think you know
The more that I am with you
The more that I am all alone

[q: C1]
[q: C2]

Not that I'm so different
Not that I don't see the /
Dying light of what we used to be
But how can I forgive you?
Just change? And I'm a /
Liar by your side, I'm about to lose my mind

'Cause I've been screaming on the inside and I know you feel the pain
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
You've been dreaming if you're thinking that I still belong to you
And I've been dying 'cause I'm lying to myself
[q: C2]
