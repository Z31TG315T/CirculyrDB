[v: 0.4 | 1]

I will wander 'til the end of time
Torn away from you

I pulled away to face the pain
I close my eyes and drift away, over the fear...

[p: PC1] That I will never find a way /
To heal my soul
And I will wander 'til the end of time [s:]
Torn away from you

[p: C1] My heart is broken
Sweet sleep, my dark angel [s:]
Deliver us from sorrow's hold
Over my heart

I can't go on living this way
But I can't go back the way I came, chained to this fear...

[q: PC1]
Half alive without you

[q: C1]
Deliver us

Change
Open your eyes to the light
I've denied it all so long, oh so long
Say goodbye
Goodbye

My heart is broken
Release me, I can't hold on
Deliver us
[q: C1]
Deliver us
[q: C1]
Deliver us from sorrow's hold
