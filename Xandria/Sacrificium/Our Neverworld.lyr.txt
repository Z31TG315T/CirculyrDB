I know that you feel like being a stranger
A yearning heart, a soul that has survived this darkness
A soul like mine, endlessly craving for more
Somewhere in a dream

[p: C1] We are one in our Neverworld
We are gone, say farewell to you all [s:]

Looking at you I can see beyond this prison /
That locks you in, hiding your true incarnation
A radiant shine, a warmth that I have never /
Felt like this before, and want to feel forever

[q: C1]
[p: C2] The closer we are coming now, the more it's getting real
Real for you and me [s:]

Together we can take piece of never
Bring it back with us and make this world our home
It's all there in the beauty of your heart

[q: C1]
[q: C2]

You and me
