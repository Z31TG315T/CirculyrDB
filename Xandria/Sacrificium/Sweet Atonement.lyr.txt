Speak to me one last time, smile at me once more
I cannot bear this distance, our memories galore
In lucid dreams I'm dancing, my cries echo, unheard
Your soul now deaf to my every bitter word

My muted love, may you rest forever
Cradled to the sound of this lullaby

In my sweet atonement we slumber secretly
[p: C1] We'll never comprehend that we never should have been
Oh, this true love's story is buried in memories [s:]

Let me crawl inside you, open your weary eyes
Heal the wound that broke you, recover all goodbyes
My muted love, when were we raided?
Who dare leave us jaded and torn?

In my sweet atonement we slumber secretly
[q: C1]

In our sweet atonement we slumber secretly
[q: C1]
And my voice was silenced the moment we started to dream
