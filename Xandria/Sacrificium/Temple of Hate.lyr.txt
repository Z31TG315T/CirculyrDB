Every day I am facing a new way of chasing /
The dreams I am losing, in constant defense
The world keeps on turning, the beds are still burning
In foolish unconsciousness and self pretense

[r: Pre-chorus 1]
Take it away, take it away, free me
Take it from me, take it from me now
Falling astray, falling astray faster
Only to see how...
[s:]

[p: C1] Deep in the shadows he's hiding for me
Down there the demon is rising
He's coming to carry my soul down with him [s:]
Down into the temple of hate

All the ways that are leading into hell's open ceiling /
Are carrying names so familiar to me
It's so hard to stay who I am when your knives rip my /
Heart out, and hit me again and again

[g: PC1]

[q: C1]
Down into the temple of hate

Oh, please help me
Oh, let me be

Take it away, take it away
Take it from me, take it from me
Falling astray, falling astray
But I will keep it...

Under surface of my smiling face
No-one can see what's behind this /
Mask I am wearing, my shield for this world
So I can survive (Because...)

[q: C1]
Down into the blackness of the temple of hate
