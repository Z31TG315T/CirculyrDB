Somewhere upon a normal day on a ancient forest way
He revealed himself to me and commands
Abandon your belief, I request no more of thee
Cast away your faith and follow me down

Take off your maiden-white dress, your skin suits you best
Be gone with your demure air

[p: C1] Hide or beseech, I am the relish in this written story
Nowhere to redeem, nowhere to run, the tale casts /
Me into his arms, into this sinful pleasure to which I now yield [s:]
Free me from my ordeal

In the morning I awoke, I recalled the words he spoke
And could not withstand his final courtship
Lead me deep into your woods, I'm your little riding hood
Hear me plead and guide me to your wolf's lair

Off with this maiden-white dress, my skin suits me best
Dive into the crimson lair

[q: C1]
Free me from my ordeal

Oh, deep in his wake
I lay down to be reborn and cradled
Let me die to only reveal /
The secrets of my core

I'm your little red relish

[q: C1]
Free me from this ordeal
