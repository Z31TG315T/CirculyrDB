I belong to a world of twilight and regret
Sing my songs to the ones who never hear it
The spell is cast, time is frozen for eternity
I know it lasts only 'til the sun is rising

Sinful is my heart, my darling
Let me share with you

[p: C1] Come with me to a place far away
Come enter the world in the shadows [s:]

All my scars are painted with the blood that I once spilled
My old heart had to see it all to win my freedom

Sinful is my soul, my darling
Let me share with you

[q: C1]
[p: C2] See through my eyes and feel what I feel
Come take my hand and just dare to believe [s:]

Come with me to a place far away
Come enter my world

[q: C1]
[q: C2]

Come with [x3]
Come with me
