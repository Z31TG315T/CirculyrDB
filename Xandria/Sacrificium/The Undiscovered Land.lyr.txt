I was born on a snowy winter's day
In a cradle of ice so cold
I was taken away when I was just a child
By the sign of the serpent's gold

[p: C1] To the sun, to the oceans
To a land I have never discovered [s:]

Now my hands have been chained to the wheel for so long
I have seen all my fellows drown
But I cannot forget what they have done to me
I am breaking my cage and run

[q: C1]
There I will go, there is my hope
To find some peace someday

The moon is rising higher
We use the dark of the night
Invade the secret tower
Get out of sight

She is the queen of nowhere
She'll be the first and the last
To reach beyond my burden
Oh our candle burns so fast

You have taken my father
And you have taken my mother
You have poisoned the souls of the weak
But you are damned to die by the hands of your own seed

Years, they pass by while my search goes on
For the ghost of the one that I loved
For I've lost my love in the rage of my revenge
So this journey will never end

[q: C1]
There I will go, there is my hope

To the seas, to the mountains
To the meadows I will never leave again
There I lay down, there is my crown
And love always
