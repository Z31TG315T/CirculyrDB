(Here it comes, the story of mankind's final glory)
(Into the nightfall)
(The showdown now has come, this will be the last curtain)
(Before the night falls)

In a desert burning, children's faces turning
Into another enemy in war
Icy winds are blowing over bodies piling high
There's no place left for more

Oh, save me from sharing this hell
Oh, save me from my blame

[r: ]
Here it comes, the story, of mankind's final glory
Into the nightfall
The showdown now has come, this will be the last curtain
Before the night falls
[s:]

We are worshipping the gods that keep twisting our thoughts
Everyday a new sensation
While a million creatures see their soil turning to dust
Hrimata eleison

Oh, save me from sharing this hell
Oh, save me from my blame

(???)

[g: Chorus]

Forever (???)
Forever (???)
You hear them crying (???)

Forever (???)
Forever (???)
This world is dying (???)

We had so much time to understand

[g: Chorus]

We are rising higher, closer to the fire
Let the final dance begin
