This is my last transmission, my final salutation
I count down to ignition, one last time I'm rising
The stars are all I think of, for me it's never enough
Their cold bliss my resource to find myself

[r: Pre-chorus 1]
I'm yearning, I'm longing
I'm waiting to go...
[s:]

[p: C1] Back to where the skies will ever take me
Down here in this prison I'll be breaking (from)
Far from here there is a place where I belong [s:]
I go home

This great black nothing calls me, an echo of the voices /
From where I have been travelling, in exile I'm living
Infinite silence waiting for me with all its answers
A lightless mirror blazing, oh, with truth so pure

[g: Pre-chorus 1]

[q: C1]
I go home

Oh, if you could see how
How small everything seems from here
So trivial, so shallow
The meaningless drama, so precious on Earth
Seen from the timeless stardust

I'm flying, I'm drifiting
I'm dying, so please let me go...

[q: C1]
Now I'll be returning home
Returning home

To the stars eternally
