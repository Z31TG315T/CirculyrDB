This is goodbye

Once, before ancient times, a circle of knights /
Were sworn to the queen of magic arts
An oath to usher her daughter to where /
She'd just tear them all apart

[r: Chorus]
Betrayer, promise breaker, beautiful liar
In your innocent, blue-eyed /
Blindness, selfish princess, go be unbound
But you'll burn your wings and hit the ground
[s:]

See her beauty so pure, she seems like the cure
To all been deluded by her light
But behind her spell we know her so well
She spoils all for what we fight

[g: Chorus]

I only want to go where the wind leads me /
And just pick the sweet fruits wherever I go
So see me now, as I am going to spread my wings

But it was us who gathered the feathers for you
It was our promise and you gave yours
Remember - your deeds make you what you are, not your intentions

(Beauty unbound) [x4]

Don't dare to think we're the ones to be blamed
Just to feel better in your own betrayal

We have gone through hell's fire, our fate in our hands
We all claimed this story will not end
When we heard you say you could have hit us /
Even harder

[g: Chorus]

You'll burn your wings and hit the ground
But you'll burn your wings and hit the ground
Go to hell
Go to hell!
