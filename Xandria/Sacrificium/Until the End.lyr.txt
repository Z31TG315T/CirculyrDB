Sometimes I'm holding my breath and keep still
When all the world's closing in for the kill
I try to embrace all the treasures I have
At times, though, I think I am losing my faith

All I have forsaken while the time is flying
I am watching all my lives passing by
And I'll...

[p: C1] Run this road 'til the end
While the world is turning around me [s:]
[p: C2] I don't know wherever I will land
Bound to the unforeseen [s:]

I see the starting point fading behind me
All of the races have always been waiting

All I longed for is gone, all the children unborn
I can only let them live in my songs

[q: C1]
[q: C2]

Where is the moment that I should caress /
When it's only yet to come?
Nothing is waiting for me, nothing

[q: C1]
I don't know when it's all over and done
So please, let me have just one more chance

[q: C1]
[q: C2]

Bound to the unforeseen
