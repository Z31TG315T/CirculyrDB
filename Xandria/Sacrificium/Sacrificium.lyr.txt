In this dark cell
In this moment of life and death
On bloody fields of war
In a forsaken desert /
Or an empty street
In a family's home
Every place where love, hate, greed, belief /
Let men look into the barrel of a gun
You can take my life, but my vision lives on eternally

(This is my legacy, now I will be forever)
(I am one with my fate, now I will see destiny)

(This is my legacy, now I will be forever)
(I am one with my fate, now I will see destiny)
(I give all of myself for all I love in this world)
(It will be my last wish, my ultimate sacrifice)

(I give all for you)

I see the white light so close
Today, there I'll be going
There are no questions, no more
There's only knowing

My last hour, I have nothing to regret
Nothing left that I could give to you
I have gone, taken everything with me
Everything that I could hide from the /
Pain that takes away my body

[r: Chorus]
(This is my legacy, now I will be forever) Hold my hand, wherever you are
(I am one with my fate, now I will see destiny) My end now is just a new life /
(I give all of myself for all I love in this world) For you all
(It will be my last wish, my ultimate sacrifice) This is my promise, my sacrifice
[s:]

My life was once just like yours
But then it happened

All has changed in a minute, like a shot
All the world, it was nothing like before
I have run through the chaos in my mind
All my life, but I never know what's /
Lying deep inside of us all

[g: Chorus]

(How hard they ever will hit my face)
(Or have to step into fire)
(No matter how long it takes for me)
(I will not fail)
(How far I have to go for my hope)
(Or have to step into fire)
(No one can anymore hold me from /)
(Falling down now)

Hold my hand wherever you are now
Please hold my hand, keep me from falling down

My old life seems like centuries ago
I remember scenes from my childhood, playing Robin Hood and Braveheart
But how do we know what we do when the story is about us?
Now I know [x2]

[g: Chorus]
[x2]

I will live on, my will lives on
Here I stand finally with my life in my hands
Let the sword fall down

Farewell to you, o stars above
Goodbye to all the ones that I have loved
I miss you so much, but it's okay
I'll sleep well 'cause somewhere you are safe
This I know when I take my last breath
