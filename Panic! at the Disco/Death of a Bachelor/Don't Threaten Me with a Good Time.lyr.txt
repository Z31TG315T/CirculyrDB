Alright, alright [x2]
It's a hell of a feeling though

Alright, alright
It's a hell of a feeling though
[x2]

Who are these people?
I just woke up in my underwear
No liquor left on the shelf
I should probably introduce myself

You should've seen what I wore
I had a cane and a party hat
I was the king of this hologram
Where there's no such thing as getting out of hand

Memories tend to just pop up
Drunk pre-meds and some rubber gloves
Five thousand people with designer drugs
Don't think I'll ever get enough (Don't think I'll ever get enough)

[r: Chorus]
Champagne, cocaine, gasoline
And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm

This night is heating up
Raise hell and turn it up, saying /
If you go on, you might pass out in a drain pipe
Oh, yeah, don't threaten me with a good time
[s:]

It's a hell of a feeling though [x2]
Alright, alright
It's a hell of a feeling though [x2]

What are these footprints?
They don't look very human-like
Now I wish that I could find my clothes
Bedsheets and a morning rose

I wanna wake up
Can't even tell if this is a dream
How did we end up in my neighbors pool /
Upside-down, with a perfect view?

Bar to bar at the speed of sound
Fancy feet dancing through this town
Lost my mind in a wedding gown
Don't think I'll ever get it now (Don't think I'll ever get it now)

[g: Chorus]

I'm a scholar and a gentleman
And I usually don't fall when I try to stand
I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt
But I make these high heels work

I told you time and time again
I'm not as think as you drunk I am
And we all fell down when the sun came up
I think we've had enough

Alright, alright
It's a hell of a feeling though [x2]
[x2]

[g: Chorus]
