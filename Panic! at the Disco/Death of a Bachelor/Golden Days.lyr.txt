[v: 0.4 | 1]

I found a pile of polaroids in the crates of a record shop
They were sex- sexy looking back
From a night that time forgot

Boy, he was something debonair in nineteen seventy-nine
And she had Farrah Fawcett hair
Carafes of blood red wine

[r: Pre-chorus and Chorus]
In the summertime [x2]

Oh don't you wonder when the light begins to fade?
And the clock just makes the colors turn to grey
Forever younger, growing older just the same
All the memories that we make will never change

We'll stay drunk, we'll stay tan, let the love remain
And I swear that I'll always paint you
Golden days [x4]
[s:]

I bet they met some diplomats on Bianca Jagger's new yacht
With their caviar and dead cigars
The air was sauna hot

I bet they never even thought about the glitter dancing on the skin
The decades might've washed it out
As the flashes popped like pins

[g: Pre-chorus and Chorus]

Time can never break your heart but it'll take the pain away
Right now our future's certain, I won't let it fade away

Golden days [x8]
