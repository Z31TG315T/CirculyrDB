You can set yourself on fire [x2]

She said "at night in my dreams, you dance on a tightrope of weird
Oh, but when I wake up you're so normal that you just disappear
You're so straight, like commuters with briefcases towing the line
There's no residue of a torturer inside of your eyes"

[p: PC1] She said "you're just like Mike Love
But you wanna be Brian Wilson, Brian Wilson" [s:]
Said "you're just like Mike Love
But you'll never be Brian Wilson"
And I said...

[r: Chorus]
If crazy equals genius [x2]
Then I'm a fucking arsonist
I'm a rocket scientist
If crazy equals genius

You can set yourself on fire
But you're never gonna burn, burn, burn
You can set yourself on fire
But you're never gonna learn, learn, learn
[s:]

She said "Darling, you know how the wine plays tricks on my tongue"
But you don't seem to change when you stuff all of your feelings with drugs
Other boys you may have dated serrated your heart with a slice
But the cut of your love never hurts, baby, it's a sweet butter knife

[q: PC1]
Said "you're just like Mike Love
But you'll never be Dennis Wilson"
And I said...

[g: Chorus]

You can set yourself on fire [x4]
