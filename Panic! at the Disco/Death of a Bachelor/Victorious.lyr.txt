[r: Bridge]
Tonight we are victorious
Champagne pouring over us
All my friends, we're glorious
Tonight we are victorious
[s:]

Victorious

Double bubble, disco queen
Headed to the guillotine
Skin as cool as Steve McQueen
Let me be your killer king

It hurts until it stops
We will love until it's not
I'm a killing spree in white
Eyes like broken christmas lights

[r: Pre-chorus]
My touch is black and poisonous
And nothing like my punch-drunk kiss
I know you need it, do you feel it
Drink the water, drink the wine
[s:]

[p: C1] Oh, we gotta turn up the crazy
Living like a washed up celebrity
Shooting fireworks like it's the fourth of July [s:]
Until we feel all right [x2]

I'm like a scarf trick, it's all up the sleeve
I taste like magic waves that swallow quick and deep
Throw the bait, catch the shark, bleed the water red
Fifty words for murder and I'm every one of them

[g: Pre-chorus]

Until we feel all right [x2]
