There's no sunshine this impossible year /
Only black days and sky gray, and clouds full of fear
And storms full of sorrow that won't disappear
Just typhoons and monsoons, this impossible year

There's no good times this impossible year /
Just a beach front of bad blood and a coast that's unclear
All the guests at the party, they're so insincere
They just intrude and exclude, this impossible year

There's no you and me this impossible year /
Only heartache and heartbreak and gin made of tears
The bitter pill I swallow, the scars souvenir
That tattoo, your last bruise, this impossible year
There's never air to breathe, there's never in-betweens
These nightmares always hang on past the dream

There's no sunshine, there's no you and me
There's no good times this impossible year
