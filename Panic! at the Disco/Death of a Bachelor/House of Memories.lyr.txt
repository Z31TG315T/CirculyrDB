If you're a lover, you should know
The lonely moments just get lonelier /
The longer you're in love /
Than if you were alone
Memories turn into daydreams /
Become a taboo

I don't want to be afraid
The deeper that I go
It takes my breath away
Soft hearts, electric souls
Heart to heart and eyes to eyes
Is this taboo?

[p: C1] Baby we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it 'til you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place / [s:]
In your house of memories

I think of you from time to time
More than I thought I would
You were just too kind
And I was too young to know /
That's all that really matters
I was a fool

[q: C1]
In your house of memories

Those thoughts of past lovers
They'll always haunt me
I wish I could believe
You'd never wrong me
Then will you remember /
Me in the same way /
As I remember you?

[q: C1]
[q: C1]
In your house of memories [x2]
Promise me a place
