[v: 0.4 | 1]

(A moment you'll never remember)
(And a night you'll never forget)

[r: Chorus]
All you sinners stand up
Sing hallelujah (Hallelujah)
Show praise with your body, stand up
Sing hallelujah (Hallelujah)

And if you can't stop shaking, lean back
Let it move right through ya (Hallelujah)
Say your prayers [x2]
Say your prayers (Hallelujah)
[s:]

My life started the day I got caught /
Under the covers with second-hand lovers
Oh, tied up in pretty young things
In a state of emergency, who was I trying to be?

Then the time for being sad is over
And you miss them like you miss no other
And being blue is better than being over it, oover it

[g: Chorus]

I was drunk and it didn't mean a thing
Stop thinking about the bullets from my mouth
I love the things you hate about yourself
Just finished a daydream, who were you trying to be?

Then the time for being sad is over
And you miss them like you miss no other
And being blue is better than being over it, over it

No-one wants you when you have no heart, and /
I'm sitting pretty in my brand new scars, and /
You'll never know if you don't ever try again, so /
Let's try [x3]

[g: Chorus]
[x2]
