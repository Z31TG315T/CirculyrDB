Do I look lonely?
I see the shadows on my face
People have told me
I don't look the same

Maybe I lost weight
I'm playing hooky
With the best of the best, pull my heart out my chest
So that you can see it too

[r: Pre-chorus]
I'm walking the long road
Watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tangles my neck
How do I live?
[s:]

[r: Chorus]
The death of a bachelor
Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor
Seems so fitting for
Happy ever after
How could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter
At the expense of the death of a bachelor
[s:]

I'm cutting my mind off
It feels like my heart is going to burst
Alone at a table for two
And I just wanna be served

And when you think of me /
Am I the best you've ever had?
Share one more drink with me
Smile even though you're sad

[g: Pre-chorus]
